<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, everyone except Joey and Chandler are there eating breakfast.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&rsquo;know if we ever go to war and you&rsquo;re captured, you&rsquo;re in for a <b>big</b> surprise.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y&rsquo;know? I mean it&rsquo;s bad enough that I&rsquo;m in love with my roommates girlfriend&mdash;which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we&rsquo;re in the room together there&rsquo;s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I&rsquo;ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she&rsquo;s smooth! Smooth! (leaves)</p>
<p>(Pause)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! Oh my God!</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey is getting a phone number from a woman (Casey) as Chandler watches from the doorway.</h3>
<p><b>Casey:</b> Here you go.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Great! All right, so I&rsquo;ll call you later.</p>
<p><b>Casey:</b> Great! (leaves)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That would be Casey. We&rsquo;re going out tonight.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Goin&rsquo; out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn&rsquo;t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, things are fine with Kathy. I&rsquo;m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (shocked) What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wait! You&rsquo;re going out with Kathy!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m upset&mdash;for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can&rsquo;t believe he just sad that.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What is the big deal? It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re exclusive.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she&rsquo;s-she&rsquo;s smart, and funny, and gets you.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You got all that from the back of her head?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right look, I think it&rsquo;s time for you to settle down. Y&rsquo;know? Make a choice, pick a lane.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Who&rsquo;s Elaine?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Ross and Monica are sitting on the couch playing cards, and Phoebe is working on a new song.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) &ldquo;<em>Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease&hellip;</em>&rdquo; Darn it! Now, I don&rsquo;t know who to get to the next verse.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you could just go uh, &ldquo;<em>greatest of ease</em>&hellip; (plays air guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn.&rdquo; Then go right into it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about &lsquo;bah-bah-bha-bhan?&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well umm, y&rsquo;know, I used to play.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right, the keyboards, huh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s when I really found my sound.</p>
<p>(Monica is taking a drink as Ross says that, laughs, and snorts her drink.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, &ldquo;The Sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I wanna hear &ldquo;The Sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven&rsquo;t played in so long, and-and, well it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s really personal stuff, y&rsquo;know?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, play that funky music white boy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in&mdash;No, yeah, okay. (Runs out.)</p>
<p>[Cut to later that same day, Ross has retrieved his keyboard and is about to debut, &ldquo;The Sound.&rdquo;]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, guys.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right! Bring it on, you&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Here we go. (Plays one note) Y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;ve-I&rsquo;ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it&rsquo;s important that-that you understand it&rsquo;s about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y&rsquo;know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!</p>
<p>(Ross starts to play. He plays a key that has a back beat sound attached to it. Over the background music he plays the sound of a barking dog, a mooing cow, a laser beam, someone coughing, a jackhammer, a doorbell, a police siren, a ray gun, breaking dishes, and for a closer he plays the sound of a loud crash. Basically, the music sucks.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm&hellip; terrific.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really, bitchin&rsquo;!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, it was so&mdash;wow!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?! I mean, really?!!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! Thanks, you guys. That&rsquo;s uh&mdash;ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I&rsquo;ll be right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I&rsquo;m&mdash;I am so&hellip; (starts to break up and leaves)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I can&rsquo;t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s so different from the stuff you usually hear.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You mean like, music?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is watching Yasmein Bleeth running on TV, and the duck starts quacking.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know what you&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo;! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s a knock on the door.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come in!</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> (entering) Hey! (sees what&rsquo;s on TV) Oh God, is that <em>Baywatch</em>?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> So is Joey around?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, he&rsquo;s not back yet, but he&rsquo;ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> I uh, don&rsquo;t really have a preference. You?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) &hellip;of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it&rsquo;s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What happened?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I&rsquo;ll be there as soon as I can.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why can&rsquo;t you tell her?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &lsquo;Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to&mdash;(he stops talking suddenly)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey! Joey!!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I thought your time ran out.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more&mdash;(his time runs out for real)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He&rsquo;s running a little late, he says he&rsquo;s sorry.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So I guess it&rsquo;s just uh, you and me then.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I think it is!</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> So what did you do today?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> (interrupting) Oh, it looks great!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;and then it got canceled.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Well, I could cut it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?! You do that?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt&rsquo;s dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don&rsquo;t make my tail too poofy.</p>
<p>[Cut to later, Kathy is cutting Chandler&rsquo;s hair.]</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> You have really great hair.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y&rsquo;know who also has great hair is Joey!</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I&rsquo;m basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.</p>
<p>(Kathy leans in really close and Chandler mouths &ldquo;Oh my God.&rdquo; She moves around in front of him and kneels at his feet.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What-what &lsquo;cha doin&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Checking to see if it&rsquo;s even.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &lsquo;Kay.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Looks good.</p>
<p>(They lean in to kiss and are interrupted by the phone.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone&rsquo;s making sounds! (On phone) Hello!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Hey dude, it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey it&rsquo;s Joey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen uh, I&rsquo;m really sorry, it looks like I&rsquo;m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn&rsquo;t there!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, it must&rsquo;ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> (on phone) Hey. (listens) Oh no it&rsquo;s fine, don&rsquo;t worry about it. (listens) Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it&rsquo;s okay. (listens) Yeah! I&rsquo;ll talk to you tomorrow. (hangs up) (to Chandler) I should uh, probably go.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Yes! Yeah.</p>
<p>(Kathy leaves and Chandler groans in agony. Kathy knocks on the door and Chandler opens it.)</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> I forgot my purse.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh.</p>
<p>(They kiss, passionately.)</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> No, I really did forget my purse.</p>
<p>(They kiss again.)</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, continued from earlier. Chandler and Kathy are still kissing, then they stop suddenly.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no-no, this is bad! It&rsquo;s bad! This is bad!</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Horrible!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> No-no-no, the kiss was good.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> No, but that&rsquo;s bad!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here&rsquo;s what we do, we-we forget it happened.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we&rsquo;re unhappy forever. Sound good?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Can you really do that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I have to; he&rsquo;s my best friend, and you&rsquo;re seeing him.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t! See-see, you&rsquo;re getting me confused, I&rsquo;m starting to urn.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I-I think we have too.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Okay. Bye.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> (outside the door) No. (Chandler opens the door and they kiss again.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross is performing, his music hasn&rsquo;t improved.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y&rsquo;know, there&rsquo;s a <em>Starbucks</em> about three blocks down.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (pushing Monica back onto the couch) It&rsquo;s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!</p>
<p>[cut back to Ross who finally finishes his so-called song with the same crash from before. He gets some applause, mainly &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;s done.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Phoebe) Hey, aren&rsquo;t you up next?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, I&rsquo;m not playing tonight.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why not?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&rsquo;t follow Ross! It&rsquo;d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed <em>The Beetles</em>. No.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, Ross sucks!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God, he&rsquo;s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!</p>
<p>(Rachel and Monica look at each other, and agree on something without saying anything.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, Phoebe you&rsquo;re&hellip; awful!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is opening the door, but Chandler has the chain on it.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Aww man! I can&rsquo;t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the door.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I sure did.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I just thought it&rsquo;d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no. <b>This</b> is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That&rsquo;s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, y&rsquo;know I&rsquo;m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I&rsquo;m gonna do that.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You mean with Casey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no, I think I&rsquo;m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Or Casey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, Kathy.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Could be Casey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No. No, Kathy.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Consider Casey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&rsquo;know what I think? I think somebody&rsquo;s got a little crush on Casey. How &lsquo;bout I fix you two up? What do you think?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross has just finished playing.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Phoebe) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don&rsquo;t want to play anymore because me and y&rsquo;know my talent. Is that true?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I-I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I mean y&rsquo;know I was trying to be really y&rsquo;know okay and upbeat about it, I just&mdash;I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y&rsquo;know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I&hellip; I won&rsquo;t play anymore.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no. No-no-no, don&rsquo;t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are sitting on the couch and Phoebe is getting coffee as Chandler enters. Ross is also there.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I kissed Kathy.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you serious?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does Joey know?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. Is there anyway, <b>anyway</b> you think he&rsquo;ll understand this?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You obviously haven&rsquo;t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all look at her) Which we all appreciate.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would&rsquo;ve just stepped aside.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, don&rsquo;t say that! Don&rsquo;t say that. That&rsquo;s not true. Is it?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think maybe, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> He loves you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then why didn&rsquo;t you tell me to do that?!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! No, that&rsquo;s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I remember that!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I remember you did.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, Chandler, you&rsquo;re gonna have to tell him.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because you do.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is watching TV as Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Samboucha Margarita?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is that a real thing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You do?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you&rsquo;re timing couldn&rsquo;t be better. She&rsquo;s not my girlfriend anymore.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, she broke up with me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh uh, when?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that&rsquo;s why I let people watch.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I&rsquo;ve been better. But, I&rsquo;m all right. So you like her huh?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, but I-I uh, don&rsquo;t have too.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no, no it&rsquo;s uh, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. You know why? &lsquo;Cause you can to me first.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you&rsquo;re work cut out for you. &lsquo;Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she&rsquo;s into some other guy. So&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> See uh, that&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Who?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;m the other guy.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> And what?! Did you sleep with her?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! No! No! I just kissed her.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!! That&rsquo;s even worse!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> How is that worse?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know! But it&rsquo;s the same!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, I&rsquo;m sorry! But there&rsquo;s nothing I can do, I think I&rsquo;m in love with her!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Over the line?! You-you&rsquo;re-you&rsquo;re so far past the line, that you-you can&rsquo;t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like &ldquo;Well, kinda.&rdquo;) Well, y&rsquo;know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there&rsquo;s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I&rsquo;m not gonna eat! You know why?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Probably because&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Because it&rsquo;s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I&rsquo;m not happy about you either. (The bread maker dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)</p>
