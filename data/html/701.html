<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Chandler, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are standing around the table drinking champagne as Ross enters.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I found a note on my door, &ldquo;Come to Monica&rsquo;s quick, bring champagne and a <i>Three Musketeers</i> bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (grabbing the candy bar) Yeah I&rsquo;ll take that.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica and I are engaged.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God. (Hugs Chandler.) Congratulations.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Where is she?</p>
<p>[Cut to Monica out on the balcony.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (yelling at the top of her lungs) I&rsquo;m engaged!!!!!! I&rsquo;m engaged!!!!</p>
<p>[Cut back inside.]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, she&rsquo;s been out there for twenty minutes, I&rsquo;m surprised you didn&rsquo;t hear her on the way over.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gay! I&rsquo;m gay!&rdquo; Can I bring her in?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, let her stay out there. It&rsquo;s sweet.</p>
<p>[Cut to Monica.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m getting married!!!! I&rsquo;m gonna be a bride!!!! (Someone else yells at her.) No, I will not shut up because I&rsquo;m engaged! (He yells again.) Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don&rsquo;t you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancée will kick your ass! (Chandler starts to look worried.) Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!</p>
<p>[Cut back inside.]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door. I&rsquo;ll be in the closet.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, continued from earlier, everyone is now in the living room drinking champagne.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a toast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say that&hellip;I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night. I mean it just wouldn&rsquo;t be my&mdash;our-our night, if you all weren&rsquo;t here to celebrate with me&mdash;us&mdash;Damnit!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Awww, come on&mdash;wait&mdash;stop it. Okay, to Monica.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> To Monica!</p>
<p>(They all say to Monica, clink their glasses, and drink.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;m kinda musical.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she&rsquo;s even had time to&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Monica) Yeah, you&rsquo;re on your own.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at <i>The Plaza</i>.</p>
<p>(They all agree and start to go and get ready.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But I-I-I can&rsquo;t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I&rsquo;m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So when you said, &ldquo;Get up early,&rdquo; did you mean 1986?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You guys don&rsquo;t think I look 19?</p>
<p>(A brief silence ensues.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!</p>
<p>(They all politely laugh and stop just as quickly.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay everybody, let&rsquo;s go! Let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p>(They all leave and Joey comes back in quickly.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh honey no, you ate it all.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I was afraid of that.</p>
<p>(Walks out and after he closes the door Phoebe turns around and takes a bite out of what is left of his candy bar.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s bedroom, they&rsquo;re getting ready.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (looking at her hand) Y&rsquo;know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) You&rsquo;re not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t think we have time.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> There&rsquo;s gonna be a wedding. You&rsquo;re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (lustily) Let&rsquo;s do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, time lapse, Chandler is fully dressed and slowly walking out of the bedroom with a distressed look on his face.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don&rsquo;t worry about it!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (motioning with his hands) I&rsquo;m not worried, I&rsquo;m uh, I&rsquo;m fascinated. Y&rsquo;know it&rsquo;s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>&rdquo;First time I met Chandler, I thought he was gay.<br>
 But here I am singing on his wedding day!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> If you would&rsquo;ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he&rsquo;s probably not gay.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey and Rachel&rsquo;s, Chandler is looking at the foosball table.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure, you guys don&rsquo;t have this problem, you&rsquo;re made of wood. (Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You look great!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (quietly) Oh, thanks.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You okay over there?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, y&rsquo;know? I feel a little umm&hellip; No, y&rsquo;know what? Never mind, I&rsquo;m gonna be fine.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.</p>
<p>[Rachel exits into the hallway just as Ross is coming up the stairs.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! Happy Monica&rsquo;s night!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well thank you, you too.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well sure. But I get married all the time so&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You okay?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I guess. I-I&hellip; I mean, do-do you think we&rsquo;re ever gonna have that?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You mean, we&mdash;you and me?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh good, you scared me for a minute.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Shake it off.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I mean&mdash;no, it&rsquo;s just &lsquo;cause, it&rsquo;s just &rsquo;cause you and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, absolutely. Y&rsquo;know like it was umm&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Surely you can think of something good.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> My hands?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to his hands) Way to go guys. Y&rsquo;know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I know. Hey, y&rsquo;know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had a bonus night!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> A what?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&rsquo;know, bonus night. Y&rsquo;know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah-yeah, we never had that,</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>
<p>[Silence.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m sure it would be amazing but I&hellip;gotta say I really-really don&rsquo;t think it would be a good idea. Y&rsquo;know? I really, really&hellip;don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: Joey and Rachel&rsquo;s, Chandler is playing <i>Playstation</i>, <i>Crash Team Racing</i> to be exact (he&rsquo;s in last on Hot Air Skyway to be more exact) as Joey enters from his room desperately trying to look like a 19-year-old. He&rsquo;s got the wool cap, he&rsquo;s got the cut-off <i>Knicks</i> jersey over the faded T-shirt, and he&rsquo;s got the whole pants-around-the-knees-showing-off-the-boxers thing that rich, white, suburban kids have adopted in a desperate and extremely futile attempt to try to look like they&rsquo;re from the inner-city.]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &lsquo;Sup? &lsquo;Sup dude?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please don&rsquo;t hurt me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So you&rsquo;re playing a little <i>Playstation</i>, huh? That&rsquo;s whack! <i>Playstation</i> is whack! &lsquo;Sup with the whack <i>Playstation</i>, &lsquo;sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on man, really how old?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Young! You&rsquo;re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody&rsquo;s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joe?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, you&rsquo;ve had a lot of sex right?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> When? Today? Some, not a lot.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, it&rsquo;s just the reason that I&rsquo;m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to&mdash;I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn&rsquo;t&hellip; There huh&mdash;hmm, there-there was an incident.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Don&rsquo;t worry about that man, that happens.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s happened to you?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Once.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, what&rsquo;d you do?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I did it anyway.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Monica is in the living room and Phoebe is in her room.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe! Come on! Let&rsquo;s go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why aren&rsquo;t you dressed yet?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, if you get ready now I&rsquo;ll let you play it at the wedding.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?! Oh that&rsquo;s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I&rsquo;ll have to pound on you for a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Fair enough, now go get ready!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. (She goes to get ready.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;ll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating my&mdash;(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.) I&rsquo;m sorry, uh apparently I&rsquo;ve opened the door to the past.</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, continued from before the commercial break. Monica is walking into the apartment followed by Ross and Rachel.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> See, I&rsquo;ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I&rsquo;m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y&rsquo;know, maybe this is selfish and I&rsquo;m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh honey, but it is just about&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It is! It is!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No it&rsquo;s not! No! No! Now it&rsquo;s about you and Ross getting back together!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are <b>not</b> getting back together!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey I swear it we just kissed.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Thunder being stolen!!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay come on Phoebe, it&rsquo;s nothing! Monica, come on!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look let&rsquo;s not make a big deal out of this! It was a <b>one</b> time thing. It doesn&rsquo;t even matter!</p>
<p>(Chandler and Joey enter and overhear that.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (angrily) I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what they were talking about Joe!!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What a great night, Chandler can&rsquo;t do it, these guys kissed&hellip; (Points to Ross and Rachel.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You guys kissed! Oh my&mdash;this is huge!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no, it&rsquo;s really not huge.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And; people thinking it&rsquo;s huge has led Monica to believe that <b>we</b> are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, we&rsquo;re still talking about it, aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well yeah, that and Chandler&rsquo;s problem.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes that would be lovely.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, you can pass for 19.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Seriously?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (gasps) I&rsquo;m 30!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, you are not! You&rsquo;re 31.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (realizes) Aww crap!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, so <i>The Plaza</i>! Okay, we&rsquo;ll get us some Mai Thai&rsquo;s, (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know what? I-I think that umm, I don&rsquo;t feel like going to <i>The Plaza</i>.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no, I-I really don&rsquo;t want to talk about it! I don&rsquo;t! (To Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Psss, that is whack!</p>
<p>[Time lapse, Phoebe is playing the guitar for Joey.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (she&rsquo;s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think I&rsquo;ll play it at the wedding.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Well, I think we&rsquo;ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, &ldquo;You look 19,&rdquo; and then they just take it away like-like, &ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I don&rsquo;t think Monica is gonna take this away.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wouldn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Would she?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You ate my candy bar!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Rachel&rsquo;s bedroom, she&rsquo;s pacing as Ross knocks on her door and opens it a little to stick his hands in.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Guess who? (Enters fully.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I just realized we kinda left some stuff up in the air&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What do you think Monica meant when she said she didn&rsquo;t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Still thinking about it huh?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I care!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (tightening his tie) And so do I.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&rsquo;know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Am I <b>going</b> to let you watch me undress?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (sitting up) No! (Exits.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s bedroom, they are both getting undressed.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe her, y&rsquo;know it&rsquo;s just&mdash;it&rsquo;s so typical.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Now Monica, I know you&rsquo;re upset, but don&rsquo;t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and <b>then</b> there&rsquo;s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Paris?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Keep talking.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it&rsquo;s romantic, but because I can!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I love you!</p>
<p>(They start making out and both start to feel something growing below the belt line.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, don&rsquo;t say anything, you might scare it away.</p>
<p>(There is a knock on the door.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s Paris, who knows we&rsquo;re here!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what&rsquo;s up? (She enters.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I&rsquo;m just gonna need a small deposit.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know, just some good faith money to hold the date.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pheebs, we&rsquo;re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)</p>
<p>[Cut to the living room, Joey is eating a sandwich.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> They break your heart, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I don&rsquo;t really need their permission.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you&hellip; You gotta do something about your eyes.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?! What&rsquo;s wrong with my eyes.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> They give you away! There&rsquo;s just-there&rsquo;s just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> And that&rsquo;ll get rid of my wisdom?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe just 10 minutes for you.</p>
<p>[Cut back to Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s room, they are making out again as there&rsquo;s another knock on the door.]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don&rsquo;t care!</p>
<p>(Monica opens the door to Ross and Rachel.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn&rsquo;t want to talk to anyone, especially me?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s not the first time you&rsquo;ve stolen my thunder.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Rachel) Hey, here&rsquo;s a thought.</p>
<p>(Rachel ignores him and follows Monica into the kitchen.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, what are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Ahh, third base.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s all everybody at the party could talk about!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, y&rsquo;know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (gasps) We had a caricaturist!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing, angrily)</p>
<blockquote>
 <blockquote>
 <p>&rdquo;<i>Whenever I get married, guess who won&rsquo;t get to sing?<br>
 Somebody named Geller</i>! <i>And somebody else named Bing</i>!&rdquo;</p>
 </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(Exits.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And yet, here we are doing it again.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh, Monica I don&rsquo;t want to steal your stupid thunder!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Got me. (He shows of his hands.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain&rsquo;t gonna happen!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, Rachel, I&rsquo;ve been thinking. I don&rsquo;t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I&rsquo;m calling it off.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&rsquo;t know! I don&rsquo;t&mdash;maybe you&rsquo;re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you&rsquo;d get married first! Maybe you can&rsquo;t stand the fact that your formerly <b>fat</b> friend is getting married before you!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wow. That&mdash;y&rsquo;know what? That is so unfair. Y&rsquo;know what? Now I <b>want</b> to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let&rsquo;s go have sex!</p>
<p>(Ross tries to dismiss it by making that sound, but decides to go for it and follows Rachel.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (yelling after them) I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re gonna have sex on my engagement night!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)</p>
<p>[Cut to Rachel&rsquo;s bedroom.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look uh, if we&rsquo;re gonna do this&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> We&rsquo;re not gonna do this, all right? She&rsquo;s just gonna think that we&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I see, so everybody wins.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s a knock on the door.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who is it?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (outside the door) It&rsquo;s Monica, open up!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oww!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I&rsquo;m going to announce that I&rsquo;m pregnant!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> How is that ever going to happen?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know why!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No you <b>don&rsquo;t</b> know why!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay! Why?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because! Because I was sad.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look, I am so&hellip;so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m not even close. And I don&rsquo;t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that&rsquo;s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!</p>
<p>(Ross looks at Chandler.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) I don&rsquo;t care, she slept with me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Anyway sweetie, I am, I&rsquo;m <b>so</b> sorry I ruined your night.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (starting to cry) I&rsquo;m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (deadpan) Well, I&rsquo;m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (at the door) And uh, Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who&rsquo;s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)</p>
