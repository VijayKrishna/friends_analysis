<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross are there, Rachel is serving brownies.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)</p>
<p>(Phoebe takes a bite and spits it out and screams.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I&rsquo;m not gonna have one.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, it&rsquo;s just my tooth.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right I&rsquo;ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So what&rsquo;s a matter, you need a dentist? I&rsquo;ve got a good one.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can&rsquo;t see him.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> See that is the problem with invisible dentists.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why? Why can&rsquo;t you go to him?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist&rsquo;s blouse.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, what? Umm&hellip;what?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend &lsquo;Albino Bob&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And all these people actually died?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, while I was in the chair! That&rsquo;s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, come on, you didn&rsquo;t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just ah, a coincidence.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well tell that to them. Oh! You can&rsquo;t, their dead.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that! (repeats) Look at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay, I&rsquo;m stopping now.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You okay?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah! Y&rsquo;know, if it&rsquo;s not a headboard, it&rsquo;s just not worth it.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is waiting for Janice to arrive, and is angrily fllipping through a magazine.</h3>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (giving her a bag) Here.</p>
<p>(Janice starts to breath into it and sucks in the reciept, and then spits it out.)</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> The receipt.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him?

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, number one, I don&rsquo;t think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I&hellip; (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You said number two.</p>

<p><b>Ben:</b> Monica.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God, he just said your name, that&rsquo;s great! Good job Ben.</p>
<p><b>Ben:</b> Monica bang!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d sound like if I exploded.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)</p>
<p>[Cut to later, all except Chandler are staring out the window at Ugly Naked Guy.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well maybe he&rsquo;s just taking a nap.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ya, he hasn&rsquo;t moved since this morning.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, we should call somebody.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn&rsquo;t moving.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, we have gotta find out if he&rsquo;s alive.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How are we gonna do that? There&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, there is one way. His window&rsquo;s open, I say, we poke him.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is throwing darts, as Joey enters.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Y&rsquo;know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, now we got a reason.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, we&rsquo;re fashioning a very long poking device.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey uh, what&rsquo;s a matter?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I talked to Janice.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God, is she going back to him?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> She doesn&rsquo;t know. Says she loves us both. Y&rsquo;know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y&rsquo;know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can&rsquo;t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you ah, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, y&rsquo;know. What, what, would you do?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I would do.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, tell me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, you&rsquo;re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I would bow out.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> They have a kid together, y&rsquo;know. They&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re like a family, and if, I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Ross has just finished putting Ben to sleep, and is entering from Rachel&rsquo;s room.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, he&rsquo;s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are you, are you, are you sure it&rsquo;s ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I&rsquo;ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y&rsquo;know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (confidently) I did!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know! I&rsquo;m saying you have to watch them all the time.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica did it?</p>
<p>(Monica runs into the kitchen from the terrace.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No. Why?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I was just playing with him, and y&rsquo;know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he&rsquo;s leaving out &lsquo;e&rsquo; and &lsquo;f.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s like they just ah, I don&rsquo;t know, fell out of his head.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, and also, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s walkin&rsquo; kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he&rsquo;s in there just sort of y&rsquo;know&hellip; (walks around in a circle)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I hope it&rsquo;s still funny when you&rsquo;re in hell.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living room)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;ll get the hat.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler and Janice are there.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not gonna be easy.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think you should go back with Gary. I don&rsquo;t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y&rsquo;know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y&rsquo;know &lsquo;You&rsquo;re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.&rsquo; and I hated that guy. And it didn&rsquo;t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Wow!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well. It&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh! You&rsquo;re right. Oh God. But, before I can say &lsquo;good-bye&rsquo;, there&rsquo;s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it&rsquo;s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie&rsquo;s been singing about. Y&rsquo;know, I mean what we have, it&rsquo;s like movie love, you&rsquo;re my soulmate, and I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then don&rsquo;t leave me!</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I&rsquo;ve got to give my marriage another chance.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No you don&rsquo;t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> (standing up) I&rsquo;m sorry. (hugs him)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohhh. Don&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn&rsquo;t let her go.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. No! No! No!</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Honey, honey, people are looking.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I don&rsquo;t care!!</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Yeah, um, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of Chandler&rsquo;s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can&rsquo;t leave! I have your shoe!</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Rachel has those in burgendy.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Joey, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are holding the giant poking device.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Can we please focus here, a naked man&rsquo;s life hangs in the balance!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m telling you he&rsquo;s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, ladies and gentlemen, let&rsquo;s poke. (they start to advance the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we&rsquo;re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the needle.</p>
<p>(They thread the needle and start poking him, he then stirs.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He&rsquo;s alive! He&rsquo;s a-live!!!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And yet, we&rsquo;re still poking him.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, retract the device, retract the device.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He does not look happy.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey-hey, now he&rsquo;s showing us his poking device.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, that&rsquo;s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is listening to a Lionel Richie album</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (singing) &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I can&rsquo;t resist your charms. And love&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (joining him) &lsquo;Love&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler and Phoebe:</b> &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be a fool for you. I&rsquo;m sure, you know I don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (high pitched) &lsquo;No you know I don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler and Phoebe:</b> &lsquo;Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh..&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &lsquo;I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &lsquo;I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler and Phoebe:</b> &lsquo;&hellip;in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched, Chandler goes low pitched) love.&rsquo; (they both look at each other.) &lsquo;My endless love.&rsquo; (once again they don&rsquo;t match tones, and they just look at each other)</p>
