<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Rachel and Monica are there. Ross walks in with a magazine in his hand.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, you&rsquo;re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to <i>Playboy</i>. They printed it!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I didn&rsquo;t know <i>Playboy</i> prints jokes.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It&rsquo;s not just about the pictures.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That didn&rsquo;t work on mom, it&rsquo;s not going to work on us.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (showing them the page) Here, check it out. It&rsquo;s the first one, too.</p>
<p>(They all laugh indifferently, except Chandler, who&rsquo;s a little angry.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I made that joke up.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, oh-oh, no you didn&rsquo;t. I did.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he&rsquo;d ever heard.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, tell Dan, &lsquo;Thanks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(Rachel is looking at the magazine and laughing.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Seriously?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, you tell a lot of jokes!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, Chandler, it&rsquo;s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don&rsquo;t print the name, so it doesn&rsquo;t really matter who gets credit, right?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey guys.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, <i>Playboy</i> printed my joke.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it&rsquo;s my joke, it&rsquo;s mine. You can call them, they&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s my joke.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s my joke.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey&rsquo;s apartment, Joey is sitting at the counter as Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Dude, you have got to turn on <i>Behind the Music</i>. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Let&rsquo;s go watch it at your place.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nah, Monica&rsquo;s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don&rsquo;t want to miss when they were skinny.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, Chandler, y&rsquo;know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, that&rsquo;s <i>VH-1</i>. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today &hellip; It&rsquo;s like a lotta noise to me. I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey, why is your cable out?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven&rsquo;t really paid the bill</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa ho.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the <i>Playboy</i> magazine).</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone bill?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Not so much.</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s, Monica and Rachel are on the couch looking at the <i>Playboy</i> magazine. When they hear someone coming, Monica goes to hide it under the sofa cushions.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (relieved) It&rsquo;s only you.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wh-wh-what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> We are looking at a <i>Playboy</i>.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a picture). Yikes!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So do you think that these pictures&mdash;Are, are they trying to tell a story?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she&rsquo;s crying out, &lsquo;Where are they, where are they?&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, she&rsquo;s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.</p>
<p>(They flip through the pages to another picture.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?</p>
<p><b>Rachel and Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You see, now, I would date this girl. She&rsquo;s cute, she&rsquo;s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that&rsquo;s got to come in handy</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I&rsquo;ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (thinks) I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Me neither.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. (Pause) Me neither.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Ross are sitting on the couch.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You forget how many great songs Heart had.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I&rsquo;m not even sure I got it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What, you didn&rsquo;t get it? The doctor is a monkey.</p>
<p>(He and Chandler crack up.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And monkeys can&rsquo;t write out prescriptions.</p>
<p>(He and Ross crack up again. Joey just sits there)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Your joke? Well, I think &lsquo;the Hef&rsquo; would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I&rsquo;ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay (he goes to sit down).</p>
<p>(Ross leaps out of his chair and runs out the door, with Chandler in hot pursuit.)</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> (handing Joey the bill) Here you go.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah, Gunther, I can&rsquo;t pay for this right now because I&rsquo;m not working, so I&rsquo;ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin&rsquo; for stuff.</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Well, if you want, you can work here.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, I don&rsquo;t know. Ya see, it&rsquo;s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y&rsquo;know? And to go from that to this, I just&hellip; Plus, I&rsquo;d have to wait on all my friends.</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Okay, but the money&rsquo;s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Flexible hours.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s bedroom, they are in bed together.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I&rsquo;m going to get a joke journal. Y&rsquo;know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you know what&rsquo;s a bad idea?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Picking Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear something?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Maybe it&rsquo;s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s coming from the living room.</p>
<p>(They go out to investigate, and find Joey wrapped in a blanket watching their television.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back to bed.)</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene, Phoebe and Rachel&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re sitting together on the couch.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey, you guys.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe and Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughing) Oh, don&rsquo;t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughing harder) Nothing, I&rsquo;m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I guess it was kinda funny.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (angrily) It wasn&rsquo;t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn&rsquo;t you pick me?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you&rsquo;re &hellip; just &hellip; kinda high maintenance&mdash;Okay let&rsquo;s go to lunch!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That is completely untrue. You think I&rsquo;m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we&rsquo;re going to go through it point by point!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, okay, you&rsquo;re right. You&rsquo;re easy-going. You&rsquo;re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She&rsquo;s just more flexible and-and mellow. That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Monica) Well, people are different.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ya, you know, Rachel &hellip; she&rsquo;ll do whatever you want. Y&rsquo;know, you can just walk all over her.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I&rsquo;m a pushover? I&rsquo;m not a pushover.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay, (laughing) you&rsquo;re not a pushover.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my &hellip; you think I&rsquo;m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You&rsquo;re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that&rsquo;s pretty strong, that&rsquo;s what I think. Come on, Monica, let&rsquo;s go to lunch. (She leaves)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her coat and leaves, too.)</p>
<p>[Cut to the hallway.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I cannot believe her.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know. Where do you wanna go eat?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m sick of Japanese. We&rsquo;re not going there.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are there as Ross enters and sees Gunther.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.</p>
<p>(Gunther looks at the joke and laughs.)</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.</p>
<p>(Ross begins to say something, realizes what Gunther just said, turns, and glares at Chandler. Chandler just shrugs it off.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m heading up there.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, yeah, I&rsquo;ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? &lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m going up there.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, thank you.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m heading up there.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> I&rsquo;d love an ice water.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You got it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a &lsquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rsquo; look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, honey, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re supposed to go back there.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Nah, it&rsquo;s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they&rsquo;re in on a secret together.)</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Don&rsquo;t wink at me. And put on your apron.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, but I don&rsquo;t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, do you work here?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Customer:</b> Hey, waiter.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah?</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, continued from earlier.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, what&rsquo;s going on. What didn&rsquo;t you tell us you work here?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s kind of embarrassing, y&rsquo;know. I mean, I was an actor and now I&rsquo;m a waiter. It&rsquo;s supposed to go in the other direction.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So is your apron. You&rsquo;re wearing it like a cape.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I mean, the job&rsquo;s easy and the money&rsquo;s good, you know? I guess I&rsquo;m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, I guess it doesn&rsquo;t seem that weird.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven&rsquo;t gotten it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> See, now it&rsquo;s weird again.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think it&rsquo;s great that you work here. You&rsquo;re going to make a lot of money, and here&rsquo;s your first tip: Don&rsquo;t eat yellow snow. (He laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y&rsquo;know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It&rsquo;s all about turnover.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, Ross. I&rsquo;ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I&rsquo;ll toss in a free muffin.</p>
<p>(He looks at Rachel and winks, she gives him the thumbs-up sign.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Phoebe and Rachel&rsquo;s, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Rachel and Monica enter.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hah!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That true, I am flaky.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, what, you&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re just okay with being flaky?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, totally.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, then, I&rsquo;m okay with being high maintenance.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&rsquo;s great. Good for you guys.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I am not high maintenance!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I am not a pushover!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Who said you were?</p>
<p><b>Monica and Rachel:</b> You did!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m flaky. I&rsquo;ll say anything.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey is coming back from using the phone.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> No, I&rsquo;m leaving to get my hair dyed.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it&rsquo;s a great part. Look, check it out. I&rsquo;m the lead guy&rsquo;s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, that seat&rsquo;s saved.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> That&rsquo;s the whole part?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, maybe he&rsquo;s not his best friend, but &hellip;</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Okay, I&rsquo;ll see you in an hour.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, man, I could totally get that part. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, that seat is taken.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Patron:</b> Oh, excuse me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, I didn&rsquo;t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?</p>
<p><b>Patron:</b> I believed you were saving this seat for someone.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So, you&rsquo;d hire me, right?</p>
<p><b>Patron:</b> For what?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.</p>
<p><b>Customers:</b> Huh? What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It&rsquo;s a very important issue in this month&rsquo;s <i>Playboy</i>. I&rsquo;m sure you all read about it.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s, Chandler and Ross are both pouting and sitting on the couch.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s my joke.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s my joke.</p>
<p><b>Ross and Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s my joke.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to settle this.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Let&rsquo;s have Monica decide.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Mon.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Mon, get out here!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why do I have to decide?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because you&rsquo;re the only one that can be fair.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t be fair. You&rsquo;re my boyfriend.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but I&rsquo;m your brother. We&rsquo;re family. That&rsquo;s the most important thing in the world.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) Don&rsquo;t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I&rsquo;m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> We&rsquo;ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth&mdash;me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, Chandler, you go first.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can I finish my story?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you want me to pick you?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> See, I would never snap at you like that.</p>
<p>(Chandler motions to Monica that he&rsquo;ll give her two babies.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Continue.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve&rsquo;s doctor&rsquo;s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, &lsquo;Doctor Monkey?&rsquo; And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I&rsquo;m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I&rsquo;m Doctor Monkey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m not arguing with that.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, I&rsquo;ve heard enough. I&rsquo;ve made my decision.</p>
<p>(Both Chandler and Ross are eager to hear her decision.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it&rsquo;s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn&rsquo;t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!</p>
<p>(Monica leaves the room)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s your joke.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is not.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel is sitting at a table and Phoebe is on the couch. Chandler and Monica can be seen outside, she&rsquo;s lecturing him, and pushes him inside. He then nods to Rachel, and is obviously counting off the seconds in his head and then Monica makes a grand enterance.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi, Chandler. There you are.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi, oh hi.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, it&rsquo;s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don&rsquo;t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?</p>
<p>(Rachel and Phoebe exchange looks.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and&mdash;(He falters and Monica prompts him.)&mdash;generosity of spirit.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really? I&rsquo;ve heard better.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Chandler) I&rsquo;m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You&rsquo;re a little high maintenance.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ahhh! <b>You</b> are on my list.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry. You&rsquo;re not easy-going, but you&rsquo;re passionate, and that&rsquo;s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I&rsquo;m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that&rsquo;s good too. So, they can say that you&rsquo;re high maintenance, but it&rsquo;s okay, because I like &hellip; maintaining you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn&rsquo;t even tell him to say that. (They hug). All right you&rsquo;re off my list.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (happily) I&rsquo;m off the list. (Sits on the couch.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (sits next to him) Phoebe, it&rsquo;s okay that you don&rsquo;t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Monica) Y&rsquo;know, suddenly I find you very attractive.</p>
<p>(Joey enters.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, buddy boy, how&rsquo;d the audition go?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Not good, no. I didn&rsquo;t get the part, and I lost my job here, so &hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! That is a bad audition.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> How-how did you lose your job here?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you&rsquo;ve been working here two days? That&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, what are ya gonna do?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, you can&rsquo;t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I&rsquo;m not going to let him get away with that. I&rsquo;m going to say something to him&mdash;No, I really shouldn&rsquo;t say anything&mdash;No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> He can have his job back.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s right, he can have his job back. I&rsquo;m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s great. Thanks Rach.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who&rsquo;s a pushover?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (returning from the bathroom) Rach, you&rsquo;re in my seat.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)</p>
