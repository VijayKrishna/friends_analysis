<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s: everyone is there and they are watching an info-mercial that stars Joey.</h3>
<p><i><b>Host:</b> Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!</i></p>
<p>Phoebe: Oh, oh! It&rsquo;s on again!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You guys, can we please not watch this all right.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Shhhh!</p>
<p><i><b>Host:</b> Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) and these darn cartons are so flingin&rsquo;-flangin&rsquo; hard to open.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Joey:</b> (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) Aw! There&rsquo;s got to be a better way!</i></p>
<p><i><b>Mike:</b> And there is Kevin.</i></p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Can we please turn this off?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo way, Kevin.</p>
<p><i><b>Mike:</b> There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you&rsquo;ll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.</i></p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Chandler) Are you intrigued?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re flingin&rsquo;-flangin&rsquo; right I am!</p>
<p><i><b>Mike:</b> Keep in mind, he&rsquo;s never used this product before, you&rsquo;re gonna see how easy this is to do. (to Kevin) Go ahead. (&rsquo;Kevin&rsquo; starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don&rsquo;t have to rip it open.) This works with any milk carton.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Joey:</b> (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.</i></p>
<p>(they all start laughing at him)</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, Janice are sitting on the couch, and Phoebe is sitting next to them in the chair.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, it&rsquo;s official there are no good movies.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Well, let&rsquo;s go to a bad one and make out. (they start to kiss and lean back into Monica.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, man. What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn&rsquo;t show up at the audition I didn&rsquo;t know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&rsquo;ll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was me!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> How is it you?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn&rsquo;t found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him her hand)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yep, that&rsquo;s my audition.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yep, and that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t invite you to play.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is unfair. I&rsquo;ll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs, you can&rsquo;t do that. The casting director doesn&rsquo;t talk to friends, she only talks to agents.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing).</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What, what are you doing? What are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice) &lsquo;Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay&rsquo;s office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she&rsquo;ll know what it&rsquo;s about.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can&rsquo;t because of the sling.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on phone) &lsquo;Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is anybody else scared?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on phone) &lsquo;Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don&rsquo;t care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?&rsquo; (to Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she tilts Chandler&rsquo;s head over and writes on the back of his neck)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, now you want a pad.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Carol and Susan are dropping off Ben</h3>
<p><b>Carol and Susan:</b> (entering) Hey!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> There&rsquo;s my boy! Here&rsquo;s my boy! And here&rsquo;s his Barbi (Ben is holding a Barbi doll) What&rsquo;s ah, what&rsquo;s my boy doing with a Barbi?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> He carries it everywhere, it&rsquo;s like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> So he&rsquo;s got a doll? So what? Unless you&rsquo;re afraid he&rsquo;s gonna grow up and be in show business.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> This doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You know what it&rsquo;s fine. If you&rsquo;re okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.</p>
<p>(cut to later in the day)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how &lsquo;bout, don&rsquo;t you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can&rsquo;t your son just play with his doll? (uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> There it is. Joey, what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, it just felt nice.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Just do it! Okay, it&rsquo;s Janice and if I get it I&rsquo;m going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that&rsquo;s great I&rsquo;m gonna have to see her tonight.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&rsquo;s the big deal? Why don&rsquo;t you wanna see Janice?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And that&rsquo;s bad because&hellip;, you hate chicken piccata?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Noo.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You didn&rsquo;t want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it&rsquo;s like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: &lsquo;Run for your life! Get out of the building!&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Men are unbelievable.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t want to go tonight, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to say something stupid.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, you know about that?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don&rsquo;t wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!</p>
<p>(Joey looks quizzically at Ross)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do we have any&hellip;(turns around and bumps Monica&rsquo;s fake chest) Do we have any thoughts here?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I&rsquo;ve never been through the tunnel myself, &rsquo;cause as I understand it, you&rsquo;re not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it&rsquo;s pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you&rsquo;re afraid of bugs&hellip;get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Amazingly, that makes sense.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You think?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I&rsquo;m staring down the barrel of a gun, I&rsquo;m pretty much peeing every which way.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Phoebe&rsquo;s beeper is going off</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure Pheebs, you know, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s there for, emergencies and pretend agents.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on baby, come on!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on phone, in &lsquo;Katelynn&rsquo;s&rsquo; voice) &lsquo;Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she&rsquo;s in her car I&rsquo;ll have to patch you through.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Very nice touch.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (in voice, on phone) &lsquo;Okay, go ahead.&rsquo; (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, &lsquo;Will he work for scale?&rsquo; you ask me. Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next&hellip;(hangs up phone) Op, went through a tunnel.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Unbelievable.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It was really fun, I mean I&rsquo;ve never talked on a car phone before.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there&rsquo;s this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn&rsquo;t get me in.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I mean it was fun one time.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on, please, it&rsquo;ll be just this one more, well actually it&rsquo;s two.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Two?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Well, well really it&rsquo;s three. Please. You&rsquo;re so good at it. I love you.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I&rsquo;ll do it, but just these three, right</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooo, four.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler and Janice are having dinner</h3>
<p><b>Janice:</b> So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &rsquo;Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you&rsquo;re sleeping with gives you contact paper.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, wait there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, you didn&rsquo;t have to do this.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you&rsquo;re my girlfriend, and that&rsquo;s what girlfriends should, should get.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would&rsquo;ve thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, not me. But that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened, and, ah, and, and there&rsquo;s more. We should take a trip.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> We should?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yep, we&rsquo;re a couple and that&rsquo;s what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> (laughs) I don&rsquo;t think we need to, because you&rsquo;re tripping me out right now! Are you okay?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I&rsquo;m here it&rsquo;s like what was the big deal. I could probably say &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s move in together.&rsquo; and I&rsquo;d be okay.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> You probably want us to move in together?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It doesn&rsquo;t scare me!</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you&rsquo;re talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn&rsquo;t even that hungry. You know what, it&rsquo;s getting a little late, and I-I should just, um&hellip;(starts to leave)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no, no, no, don&rsquo;t go! I&rsquo;ve scared ya&rsquo;! I&rsquo;ve said too much! I&rsquo;m hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It&rsquo;s me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica and Rachel are comforting Chandler</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.</p>
<p><b>Rachel and Monica:</b> Uff.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That is never good.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then I got all needy and clingy.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad. How did you leave it?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> She said she&rsquo;d call me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel and Monica:</b> Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh God.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Welcome to our side of the tunnel.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well that&rsquo;s that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, you do.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m terminal?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, no, not at all, you&rsquo;re not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay. So, should I call her?</p>
<p><b>Rachel and Monica:</b> Nooo!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> She has to know that your not ready.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So I&rsquo;m not, not gonna lose her?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oooh, honey, you&rsquo;re not a total loser.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I said, &rsquo;so I&rsquo;m not gonna lose her?&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Ross is still trying to get Ben to play with something other than the Barbi doll.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Guess who&rsquo;s here. It&rsquo;s the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) &lsquo;A real American hero. I&rsquo;m G.I. Joe!&rsquo; Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> G.I. Joe? Do you really think he&rsquo;s gonna fall for that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look Ben, it&rsquo;s a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!</p>
<p><b>Joey and Ross:</b> Go Joe!!!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs! There you are!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No it&rsquo;s not, sorry.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn&rsquo;t recognize you wearing, in those&hellip;pants.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes! They called and you didn&rsquo;t get it! Okay, I mean you didn&rsquo;t get it, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s okay, these things happen.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But they shouldn&rsquo;t happen, you know what, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don&rsquo;t wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, now you&rsquo;re sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I&rsquo;m sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No! No, no you can&rsquo;t quit! You&rsquo;re the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can&rsquo;t take it personally.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> They actually said that?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Ooh God, there&rsquo;s that face again! See I can&rsquo;t do this job! I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, no, see that&rsquo;s why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like &lsquo;They went another way&rsquo;, but this, I can use this. (in a very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (running into the hall, in slow motion) You&rsquo;ll never get me, Joe!!! (he then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler&rsquo;s door, dead.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A grocery store that Janice shops in. Chandler is on purpose, accidentally bumping into her.</h3>
<p><b>Janice:</b> (to butcher) No, thank you. (Chandler makes a sound and she notices him) Chandler!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (in a British accent) Hello, Janice.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> What are you doing here?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How&rsquo;ve you been?</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Are you being British?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (normal voice) No. Not anymore.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Why are you shopping here? You don&rsquo;t live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, huh. I&rsquo;m just uh, you know I&rsquo;m just picking up some things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Barley? What kind of party serves barley?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m sorry if my friends aren&rsquo;t as sophisticated as yours.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Where is this party?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here in Chelsea.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Who&rsquo;s party is it?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> A woman&rsquo;s</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> What woman?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (shyly) Chelsea.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you&rsquo;re seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you&rsquo;re pretending that you&rsquo;re seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be? (another guy walks by)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can I be that guy?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are there</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, shoot.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I didn&rsquo;t get it?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. They said you &lsquo;Weren&rsquo;t believable as a human being.&rsquo; So, you can work on that.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, what else?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, the off-Broadway play people said &lsquo;You were pretty but dumb&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no wait, I&rsquo;m sorry, that&rsquo;s &lsquo;pretty dumb.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, it&rsquo;s okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I&rsquo;m gonna have to go back to Estelle.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well don&rsquo;t get me wrong, you&rsquo;re a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don&rsquo;t want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, no, I understand.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You do, thanks.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait a minute.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (in a really, really bad Italian accent) That&rsquo;s-ah what I suspected-ah.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is laying on the counter and Rachel and Monica are comforting him again.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> My God! Chandler, we said be &lsquo;aloof&rsquo; not &lsquo;a doof&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;ve actually ruined this haven&rsquo;t I? It&rsquo;s time for the good ice cream now, right?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know what, everything&rsquo;s gonna be okay.</p>
<p>(phone rings)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Shhh&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, and grumpy.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I&rsquo;m so glad that you called, I know I&rsquo;ve been acting a really weird lately. And, it&rsquo;s just because I&rsquo;m crazy about you, and I just got&hellip;stupid, and, and scared, and&hellip;stupid a couple of more times. I&rsquo;m sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> He&rsquo;s soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she&rsquo;d be sleeping with somebody else by now.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone) I love you too.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Aw, it&rsquo;s soo unfair. (they both start digging into the &lsquo;good&rsquo; ice cream)</p>
