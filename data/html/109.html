<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel is confronting her boss, Terry.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Terry, I, I, I know that I haven&rsquo;t worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> An advance?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&rsquo;s so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You&rsquo;re a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, I, I hear what you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m with you. Um, but I, but I&rsquo;m trying really hard. And I think I&rsquo;m doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.</p>

<h3>Opening Credits</h3>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel is approaching a customer.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there&rsquo;s a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?</p>
<p><b>Guy:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, ok, that&rsquo;s fine. Fine. Hey, I&rsquo;m sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go.</p>
<p>(Monica enters.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I am not wrong.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, I just talked to them.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (getting up, upset) I&rsquo;m calling Mom.</p>
<p>(Joey enters. His face looks abnormally colorful.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, hey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s so funny, &rsquo;cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What were you modeling for?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You know those posters for the city free clinic?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, wow, so you&rsquo;re gonna be one of those &ldquo;healthy, healthy, healthy guys&rdquo;?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know, the asthma guy was really cute.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do you know which one you&rsquo;re gonna be?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so&hellip; (crosses fingers)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good luck, man. I hope you get it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p>(Ross comes back to the couch.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It&rsquo;s Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, I&rsquo;ll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I&rsquo;ll make it just like Mom&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, they&rsquo;re not actually supposed to have&hellip; (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I&rsquo;ll work on the lumps. Joey, you&rsquo;re going home, right?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, every single one of them.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you&rsquo;re gonna be with your grandma?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, and her boyfriend. But we&rsquo;re celebrating Thanksgiving in December &rsquo;cause he is lunar.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So you&rsquo;re free Thursday, then.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Oh, can I come?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you&rsquo;re gonna make it to Vail?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I thought it was $98.50.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m off to Carol&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, ooh! Why don&rsquo;t we invite her?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she&rsquo;s my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Carol and Susan&rsquo;s apartment, Susan is there. Ross enters.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi, is uh, is Carol here?</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> No, she&rsquo;s at a faculty meeting.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but&hellip;<b>Susan:</b> Come in.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> What&rsquo;s it look like?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Kinda like a big face without skin.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Yes, I&rsquo;m familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein&rsquo; a lesbian.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don&rsquo;t let you do it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Actually, I&rsquo;m reading it to the baby.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> The uh, the baby that hasn&rsquo;t been born yet? Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean you&rsquo;re&hellip; crazy?</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> What, you don&rsquo;t think they can hear sounds in there?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re not serious, I mean, you really&hellip; you really talk to it?</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Do you uh, do you talk about me?</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Yeah, yeah, all the time.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, everyone is there but Rachel.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, if she&rsquo;s talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we&rsquo;ll all talk, and you&rsquo;ll hear everything we say.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;d just like to say that I&rsquo;m totally behind this experiment. In fact, I&rsquo;d very much like to butter your head.</p>
<p>(Rachel enters.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Rach, did you make your money?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, here&rsquo;s your mail.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks, you can just put it on the table.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (insistently) No, here&rsquo;s your mail.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks, you can just put it on the table.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?</p>
<p>(Rachel opens it. Inside is the money she needed.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We all chipped in.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Monica) We did?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you. Thank you so much!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin&rsquo;s, and your family size bag of Funyuns.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you&rsquo;re havin&rsquo; for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, I&rsquo;m nine years old.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I hate this story.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have&mdash;and I remember this part vividly&mdash;a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they&rsquo;re getting divorced.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my god.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. It&rsquo;s very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you&rsquo;ve seen it in reverse.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The subway, Joey spots a gorgeous woman waiting. He goes up to her.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.</p>
<p><b>Girl:</b> We did?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, at Macy&rsquo;s. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?</p>
<p><b>Girl:</b> Yeah, right.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I gotta tell you. You&rsquo;re the best in the business.</p>
<p><b>Girl:</b> Get out.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m serious. You&rsquo;re amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.</p>
<p><b>Girl:</b> Really? You don&rsquo;t know what that means to me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, you smell great tonight. What&rsquo;re you wearing?</p>
<p><b>Girl:</b> (provocatively) Nothing.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?</p>
<p><b>Girl:</b> Yeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p><b>Girl:</b> I just remembered, I have to do something.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. What?</p>
<p><b>Girl:</b> Um, leave.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait, wait, wait!</p>
<p>(Joey turns around and sees his face on a poster in the subway. The poster says: What Mario isn&rsquo;t telling you&hellip;V.D., you never know who might have it. A variety of scenes are shown with the poster displayed all over New York City.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey enters, amongst snickers from the gang.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So I guess you all saw it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Saw what?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Joey enters, upset.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tonight, on a very special Blossom.</p>

<h3>Commercial Break</h3>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is standing in the doorway, not wanting to participate in the festivities.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider&rsquo;s mulling, turkey&rsquo;s turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, that&rsquo;s it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s closer.</p>
<p>(Rachel enters, excited.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, you must stop shooping.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, I&rsquo;m gonna get my stuff.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, will you just come in already?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.</p>
<p>(Phoebe takes a slice of pumpkin pie and waves it in front of Chandler&rsquo;s face.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that&rsquo;s not funny anymore.</p>
<p>(Chandler leaves.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don&rsquo;t see any tater tots.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s not a question.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But my mom always makes them. It&rsquo;s like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It&rsquo;s bad enough I can&rsquo;t be with my family because of my disease.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, fine. Tonight&rsquo;s potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, I&rsquo;m off to talk to my unborn child.</p>
<p>(Ross grabs for some food, Monica slaps his hand away.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ah!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, Mom never hit.</p>
<p>(Ross exits.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (stirring pot) Ok, all done.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why would we do that?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, &rsquo;cause then they&rsquo;d be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!</p>
<p>(Chandler enters, running.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> The balloon?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It&rsquo;s all over the news. Right before he reached <em>Macy&rsquo;s</em>, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to the roof, who&rsquo;s with me?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can&rsquo;t, I gotta go.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Almost never.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Got the keys? <i>or</i> Got the keys!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok.</p>
<p>(Everyone leaves the apartment.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Carol and Susan&rsquo;s, Ross is preparing to talk to her belly.</h3>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Anytime you&rsquo;re ready.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Just aim for the bump.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can&rsquo;t do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> So don&rsquo;t do it, it&rsquo;s fine. You don&rsquo;t have to do it just because Susan does it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, the group is coming back from the roof.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> We&rsquo;re waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, you do. When we left, you said, &ldquo;got the keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No I didn&rsquo;t. I asked, &ldquo;got the ke-eys?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, no, you said, &ldquo;got the keys&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do either of you <b>have</b> the keys?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (panicked) The oven is on.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I gotta get my ticket!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well then get it, get it!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That tone will not make me go any faster.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (angry) Joey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That one will.</p>
<p>(Joey leaves to get the copy of the key.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Carol and Susan&rsquo;s, Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And everyone&rsquo;s telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I&rsquo;m saying, because, let&rsquo;s face it, you&rsquo;re a fetus. You&rsquo;re just happy you don&rsquo;t have gills anymore.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Look, you don&rsquo;t have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?</p>
<p>(Susan enters.)</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Hi, how&rsquo;s it goin?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Shh! (singing) <em>Here we come, walkin&rsquo; down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey</em>! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> I did.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Does it always, uh&mdash;?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> No, no that was the first.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Keep singing! Keep singing!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (singing) <em>Hey, hey, you&rsquo;re my baby, and I can&rsquo;t wait to meet you. When you come out I&rsquo;ll buy you a bagel, and then we&rsquo;ll go to the zoo</em>.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> I felt it!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (singin) <em>Hey, hey, I&rsquo;m your daddy. I&rsquo;m the one without any breasts</em>.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Hallway, Joey has a tray full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Nope, not that one.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Can you go any faster with that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I swear you said you had the keys.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I didn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn&rsquo;t have the keys.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, ok, that&rsquo;s it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.</p>
<p>(Short pause.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why would I have the keys?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aside from the fact that you said you had them?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> But I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you should have.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn&rsquo;t it enough that I&rsquo;m making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I&rsquo;m making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it&rsquo;s my first Thanksgiving, and it&rsquo;s all burned, and, and I&hellip; I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door&rsquo;s open. Here we go.</p>
<p>(They walk in. Smoke fills the apartment.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, the turkey&rsquo;s burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.</p>
<p>(Ross enters, singing.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Here we come, walkin&rsquo; down the&mdash;this doesn&rsquo;t smell like Mom&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, it doesn&rsquo;t, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I&rsquo;m stuck here with you guys.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody&rsquo;s first choice.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You call that delicious?</p>
<p>(all shouting)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Stop it, stop it, stop it!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Now this feels like Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>[Time lapse. Everyone is upset with each other. Phoebe is at the window.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ugly Naked Guy&rsquo;s taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He&rsquo;s not alone. Ugly Naked Guy&rsquo;s having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.</p>
<p>(They all run to the window.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;ve gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s nice that he has someone.</p>
<p>[Time lapse. The gang is around the table, eating grilled cheese sandwiches.]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Shall I carve?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> By all means.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t even wanna know about the dark cheese.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I will.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Make a wish?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What&rsquo;d you wish for?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> The bigger half.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;d like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn&rsquo;t the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn&rsquo;t involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you&rsquo;d gone to Vail, and if you guys&rsquo;d been with your family, if you didn&rsquo;t have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn&rsquo;t be all together, you know? So I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that I&rsquo;m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> That&rsquo;s so sweet.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And hey, here&rsquo;s to a lousy Christmas.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And a crappy New Year.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here, here!</p>

<h3>Closing Credits</h3>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Subway, Joey sees his poster and he peels off the caption on his poster, revealing more posters underneath. The captions read, as follows:</h3>
<blockquote>
 <p>Bladder Control Problem<br>
 Stop Wife Beating<br>
 Hemorrhoids?<br>
 Winner of 3 Tony Awards&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s finally happy with that and walks away.]</p>
