<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, the whole gang is there, Ross is showing pictures of his new baby boy, Ben, to the group.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And here&rsquo;s little Ben nodding off&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Awww, look at Aunt Monica&rsquo;s little boy!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look, he&rsquo;s got Ross&rsquo;s haircut!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!</p>
<p>(Ross is practically drooling over Rachel at this point.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (quietly) That would be nice.</p>
<p>(Chandler, annoyed with Ross&rsquo;s fawning, makes a &lsquo;pfft&rsquo; noise.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pardon?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)</p>
<p>(Joey is looking at his check.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I&rsquo;ll pay you back.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah, right, OK&hellip; inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me&hellip; 17 jillion dollars.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I will, really. I&rsquo;ll pay you back this time.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sigh)&hellip; And where&rsquo;s this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some&hellip; research.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (overhearing) What kind of research?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, just, y&rsquo;know&hellip; science.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Science. Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ve heard of that. (everyone&rsquo;s interest is piqued, they all look over)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (sigh)&hellip; It&rsquo;s a fertility study.</p>
<p>(Rachel laughs.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Joey, please tell me you&rsquo;re only donating your <b>time</b>.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright, come on you guys, it&rsquo;s not that big a deal. Really&hellip; I mean, I just go down there every other day and&hellip; make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, ooh, you&rsquo;re gonna be making money hand over fist!</p>

<h3>Opening Credits</h3>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica and Phoebe are preparing for a barbecue for Rachel&rsquo;s birthday.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We&rsquo;ve got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew&hellip; (hands meat to Monica)</p>
<p>(Chandler and Joey enter with charcoal.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (in a deep voice) Men are here.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We make fire. Cook meat.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.</p>
<p><b>Monica and Phoebe:</b> Ewww!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she&rsquo;s gonna be late.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, OK.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your (provocatively) special someone?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, she&rsquo;s, uh&hellip; she&rsquo;s pretty great.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What, you think I&rsquo;m gonna tell a girl I like that I&rsquo;m also seeing a cup?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Man&rsquo;s got a point.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, the tough thing is, she <b>really</b> wants to have sex with me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Crazy bitch.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I&rsquo;m not allowed to conduct any&hellip; ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey&hellip; we <b>always</b> know what you mean.</p>
<p>[Time lapse. Chandler and Joey are making the fire, Monica and Phoebe are inside. Ross enters, carrying luggage.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m going to China.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Jeez, you say one thing, and&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You&rsquo;re going to China?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, i-it&rsquo;s for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don&rsquo;t want us to have the bone, so I&rsquo;m going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I&rsquo;m gonna be gone for like, uh&hellip; like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can&rsquo;t. So here&rsquo;s my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um&hellip; here&rsquo;s a picture of me&hellip; (hands it to Monica)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Monica): Could you take it to Carol&rsquo;s every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn&rsquo;t forget me?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p>(Phoebe puts the picture of Ross up to her face.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi, Ben. I&rsquo;m your father. I am&hellip; the head. Aaaaaahhhh&hellip; (puts picture down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no, she&rsquo;s out having drinks with Carl.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. (pause) Hey, who&rsquo;s Carl?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, well, see, there&rsquo;s this guy she met at the&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> At the coffeehouse, right.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So you <b>do</b> know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> OK, I&rsquo;m gonna go say goodbye to the guys.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hey, y&rsquo;know what? Tell them that bone story.</p>
<p>(Ross goes outisde on the balcony.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (sigh)&hellip;I have to go to China.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> The country?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom&rsquo;s breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, let&rsquo;s see&hellip; Alvin&hellip; Simon&hellip; Theodore&hellip; no.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, Rachel&rsquo;s having drinks with him tonight.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no! How can she do that when she&rsquo;s never shown any interest in you?!?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> <b>Forget</b> about her.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> He&rsquo;s right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Course there, they just call it food.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah&hellip; I guess. I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. Alright, just&hellip; just give her this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen, buddy, we&rsquo;re just looking out for you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but&hellip; I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m still on my first. I just think you&rsquo;re nice.</p>
<p>[Time lapse. Melanie, Joey&rsquo;s girlfriend, is there with Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel. Ross is gone.]</p>
<p><b>Melanie:</b> Anyway, that&rsquo;s when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves &lsquo;The Three Basketeers.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey&rsquo;s stupidity)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)</p>
<p>(Everyone follows Rachel to the living room. Monica pulls Joey aside.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, hold on there, tiger. How&rsquo;s it going? How you holding up?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we&rsquo;re gonna&hellip; complete the transaction, if you know what I&hellip;</p>
<p>(Monica rolls her eyes.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Then you do. Heh, heh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So, uh, have you ever thought about being there <b>for her</b>?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know, just be there <b>for her</b>.</p>
<p>(Long pause&hellip; Joey looks confused.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Not following you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Think about it.</p>
<p>(They both walk over to where Rachel is opening her gifts. Rachel sees her first gift is a fruit basket.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, I&rsquo;m guessing this is from&hellip;</p>
<p>(Melanie smiles.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, thank you, Melanie.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (picks it up) OK&hellip; ah, it&rsquo;s light&hellip; (shakes it)&hellip;it rattles&hellip; it&rsquo;s&hellip; (opens it) <i>Travel Scrabble</i>! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)</p>
<p>(Chandler looks dejected. Rachel picks up another gift.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> This one&rsquo;s from Joey&hellip; feels like a book. Thinks it&rsquo;s a book&hellip; feels like a book. And&hellip;(opens it)&hellip;it&rsquo;s a book!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s Dr. Seuss!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.</p>
<p><b>Melanie:</b> There is a little child inside this man!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he&rsquo;ll die.</p>
<p>(Rachel picks up the next gift.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who&rsquo;s this from?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that&rsquo;s Ross&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh&hellip; (opens it)&hellip; (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Remembered what?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can&rsquo;t believe he remembered!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his <i>Travel Scrabble</i> game)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe he did this.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?</p>
<p>(Everyone looks at him. He realizes he just spilled the beans about Ross&rsquo;s crush on Rachel. You can hear this entire classic scene by clicking here.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What did you just say?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (panicked) ahem&hellip; um&hellip; Crystal duck.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, no&hellip; the, um, the&hellip; &lsquo;love&rsquo; part?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (stuttering incoherently) F-hah&hellip; flennin&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh&hellip; my God.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (pats Chandler on the leg) That&rsquo;s good, just keep rubbing your head. That&rsquo;ll turn back time.</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, continued from earlier.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean, this is unbelievable.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know. This is really, really huge.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s small. It&rsquo;s tiny. It&rsquo;s petite. It&rsquo;s wee.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nuh-uh. I don&rsquo;t think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK, is there a mute button on this woman?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just&hellip; (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, given that he&rsquo;s desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn&rsquo;t mind getting a cup of coffee or something.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross? All this time? Well, I&rsquo;ve got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (quickly) H-He&rsquo;s in China!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> The country.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, no, wait. (checks Ross&rsquo;s itinerary) His flight doesn&rsquo;t leave for another forty-five more minutes.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What about the time difference?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> From here to the airport?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You&rsquo;re never gonna make it!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, what&rsquo;re you gonna say to him?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I-I-I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well then maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> He&rsquo;s right, cause if you&rsquo;re just gonna, like, break his heart, that&rsquo;s the kind of thing that can wait.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but if it&rsquo;s good news, you should tell him now.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe I&rsquo;ll know when I see him.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Here, look, alright, does this help?</p>
<p>(Phoebe gets up, holds the picture of Ross up to her face.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noooo&hellip; look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y&rsquo;know, I just, I&rsquo;ve just gotta talk to him. I&hellip; I gotta&hellip; OK, I&rsquo;ll see you later. (opens door)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Airport, Ross has headphones on, and is listening to a &lsquo;How To Speak Chinese&rsquo; tape. Occasionally, he makes an outburst in Chinese in accordance with the tape. He is getting on the jetway. The flight attendant is there.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (something in Chinese)</p>
<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> Alright!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)</p>
<p>(Rachel runs into the airport, trying to catch Ross, moving people out of the way.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me&hellip;</p>
<p>(Rachel gets up to the jetway.)</p>
<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> May I see your boarding pass?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, no, no, I don&rsquo;t have one. I just need to talk to my friend.</p>
<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> Oh, oooh. I&rsquo;m sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I know, but I&mdash;he just went on. He&rsquo;s right there, he&rsquo;s got the blue jacket on, I&hellip; can I j-just&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> No no no! Federal regulations!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, alright, OK, um&hellip; then could you please, uh&hellip; just give him a message for me? Please? This is <b>very</b> important.</p>
<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> Alright. What&rsquo;s the message?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>[Cut to the Jetway, the flight attendant enters, walks past Ross, and approaches an older man with his wife who is also wearing a blue jacket.]</p>
<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh&hellip; I have a message for you.</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> (confused) What?</p>
<p><b>Flight Attendant:</b> It&rsquo;s from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> (to wife): Toby&hellip; Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s talking about! There&rsquo;s no Rachel! Don&rsquo;t give me that deep freeze.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey&rsquo;s Bedroom, he and Melanie are in bed together.</h3>
<p><b>Melanie:</b> Mmmmmm&hellip; Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey&hellip; I think I blacked out there for a minute!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Heh, heh. It was nothin&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Melanie:</b> Well, now we&rsquo;ve gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing his chest)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (panicked) Uhhh.. y&rsquo;know what? Forget about me. Let&rsquo;s, uh&hellip; let&rsquo;s give you another turn.</p>
<p><b>Melanie:</b> (surprised) M-Me again?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure! Why not?</p>
<p><b>Melanie:</b> Boy, somebody&rsquo;s gonna get a <b>big</b> fruit basket tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Joey starts to kiss her.)</p>
<p><b>Melanie:</b> Oooh, I gotta tell you&hellip; you are nothing like I thought you would be.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> How do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Melanie:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who&rsquo;re always &rsquo;me, me, me.&rsquo; But you&hellip; you&rsquo;re a giver. You&rsquo;re like the most generous man I ever met. I mean&hellip; you&rsquo;re practically a woman.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are there. Monica is holding the wrapping paper from one of Rachel&rsquo;s gifts.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh&hellip; do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it&rsquo;s only a little bit torn&hellip; so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back&hellip; and, uh, oh, you guys, y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s <b>Ross</b>. Y&rsquo;know what I mean? I mean, it&rsquo;s <b>Ross</b>.</p>
<p><b>Monica and Phoebe:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling&hellip; but I&rsquo;m thinking&hellip; oh, I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;d be really great.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we&rsquo;d be like friends-in-law! Y&rsquo;know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it&rsquo;s like starting on the fifteenth date!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but, y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s&hellip; it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Another good point.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I mean, I mean, when you&rsquo;re at the fifteenth date, y&rsquo;know, you&rsquo;re already in a very relationshippy place. Y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s&hellip; you&rsquo;re committed.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (confused) Huh?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn&rsquo;t work out?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why isn&rsquo;t it working out?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Is he not cute enough for you?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Does he not make enough money?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I&rsquo;m just&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe there&rsquo;s someone else.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wha&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Is there? Is there someone else?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! There is.. there is noone else!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is eating breakfast, Joey quietly opens his bedroom door.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, big&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Shhhh!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (quietly) &hellip;spender.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> She&rsquo;s still asleep.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So how&rsquo;d it go?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you&rsquo;re great in bed?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> The fact that you&rsquo;d even ask that question shows how little you know me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, it&rsquo;s like, last night, I couldn&rsquo;t do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got&hellip; man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It was amazing! And not just for her&hellip; uh-uh. For me, too. It&rsquo;s like, all of a sudden, I&rsquo;m blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y&rsquo;know? It&rsquo;s like&hellip; I was able to appreciate it on another level.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I didn&rsquo;t know you had another level.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I know! Neither did I!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, one week later. Monica is seated, Rachel comes out of her bedroom.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, from who?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, it&rsquo;s the thought. Hey, doesn&rsquo;t Ross&rsquo;s flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y&rsquo;know, honey, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it and I&rsquo;ve decided this&mdash;this whole Ross thing, it&rsquo;s just not a good idea.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, why?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because, I feel like I wouldn&rsquo;t just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don&rsquo;t wanna&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you&rsquo;re already so&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I am not &rsquo;so&rsquo;! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but&hellip; I&rsquo;ll be good. I promise.</p>
<p>(Door buzzer goes off. Rachel answers it.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who is it?</p>
<p><b>Intercom:</b> It&rsquo;s me, Carl.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> C&rsquo;mon up.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Behind my brother&rsquo;s back? (Rachel glares at her) &hellip; is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won&rsquo;t be hearing from me.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is seated, and the apartment is filled with baskets of fruit. Joey enters, check in hand.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Seven hundred bucks!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y&rsquo;know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really? So, you&rsquo;re gonna stick with this &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all for her&rsquo; thing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s Balcony, Rachel is having drinks with her date, Carl.</h3>
<p><b>Carl:</b> I&rsquo;m just sayin&rsquo;, if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that <b>stupid</b> electric car, I&rsquo;m gonna shoot myself! I mean, don&rsquo;t get me wrong&hellip; I&rsquo;m not against environmental issues <b>per se</b>&hellip; it&rsquo;s just that guy!</p>
<p>(Rachel looks bored. At this point, Ross&mdash;a figment of Rachel&rsquo;s imagination&mdash; shows up on the balcony and starts talking to her.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d rather go out with him than me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Would you excuse me, please? I&rsquo;m trying to have a date here.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine, just stop thinking about me.</p>
<p>(She tries, and Ross disappears momentarily. He reappears, standing closer to her.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Can&rsquo;t do it, can you?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So I&rsquo;m thinking about you. So what?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well&hellip; he happens to be a very nice&hellip; guy&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Carl:</b> I mean, come on, buddy, get a <b>real car</b>!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, it&rsquo;s too hard.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, no&hellip; why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I&rsquo;ve been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you&rsquo;re like my best friend.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> If we broke up, and I lost you&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we&rsquo;re gonna break up?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven&rsquo;t broken up?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (pause) No. But&hellip; it only has to happen <b>once</b>. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean&hellip; so, the only question is&hellip; are you attracted to me?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I mean, I&rsquo;ve never looked at you that way before.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, start looking.</p>
<p>(They kiss. Ross walks away, and then fades out.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>Carl:</b> Exactly! And you just know I&rsquo;m gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right! You&rsquo;re right!</p>
<p><b>Carl:</b> Heh&hellip; y&rsquo;know?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You know what?</p>
<p><b>Carl:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I forgot&hellip; I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I&rsquo;m so&hellip; if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do&hellip; (gives him her drink) I mean&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>(Rachel leaves.)</p>
<p><b>Carl:</b> But&hellip;</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: Airport. Madonna&rsquo;s <i>Take A Bow</i> plays in the background as Rachel waits at the gate with flowers.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.</p>
<p>[Cut to the jetway, the old man who the flight attendant delivered Rachel&rsquo;s message to gets off the plane, his wife still upset with him.]</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> For God&rsquo;s sake, will you let it go? There&rsquo;s no Rachel!</p>
<p>(A Chinese woman getting off the plane drops one of her bags. Ross gets off next.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, hey, hey, I got that.</p>
<p>(Ross picks up the bag&hellip; then he and the woman kiss.)</p>
<p><b>Julie:</b> Oh, thanks, sweetie.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.</p>
<p><b>Julie:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Julie:</b> You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll judge and ridicule me?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, they will. I just&hellip; uh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross and Julie:</b> Can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, they&rsquo;re gonna love you.</p>
<p>[Cut to a close-up of Rachel, eagerly awaiting Ross&rsquo;s arrival&hellip; not knowing he is getting off the plane with another woman.]</p>
