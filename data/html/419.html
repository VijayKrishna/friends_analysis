<h3><b>Scene:</b> Rachel&rsquo;s bedroom; Rachel is awoken by a man singing in the next apartment.</h3>
<p><b>The Singing Man:</b> (singing, duh) Morning&rsquo;s here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning&rsquo;s here! The morning&rsquo;s here!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> HEY!! Do you <b>have</b> to do that? It&rsquo;s Saturday!</p>
<p><b>The Singing Man:</b> Oh come on! Morning&rsquo;s here! (Starts singing) Morning&rsquo;s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!</p>
<p>(Rachel slams shut her window and storms into the living room, where Joey and Monica are eating breakfast.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I <b>hate</b> this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Morning&rsquo;s here! Morning is here&mdash;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, you don&rsquo;t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know what? I am <b>really</b> tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> See, this is a <b>great</b> apartment.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Shut up! This place is a hole!</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross&rsquo;s bedroom; Ross and Emily are making out. Ross as a new feature.</h3>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh, blimey, I still can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve got an earring!</p>
<p>(Yep, it&rsquo;s a little gold loop.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around, pretending like he&rsquo;s jamming.)</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> He does that?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, I don&rsquo;t know, whatever.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> I think it makes you look really dangerous.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I know. Y&rsquo;know what, I never would&rsquo;ve gotten this if it weren&rsquo;t for you. No really, when I&rsquo;m with you I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m like this whole other guy, I <b>love</b> that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> I love both of you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p>(They kiss.)</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to go.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Then don&rsquo;t. Stay here. Just don&rsquo;t go so soon to London, just one more day.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Ohh, Ross, please!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> One more day, seriously/</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Don&rsquo;t do this to me, again. You&rsquo;d know I&rsquo;d stay here in a minute, but I&rsquo;d really miss so much work, they&rsquo;ll fire me.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So, then you can stay as long as you want.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> I wish I could.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t start packing. Come on! (She puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> I don&rsquo;t think you understand packing. Look, I just don&rsquo;t want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> You didn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No. No, I didn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t want to be <b>that</b> guy.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s erm, Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey and Chandler are watching one of those Kung Fu movies and imitating the moves.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ho! Ho! Ho!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Excuse me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Your pants!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah! You like &lsquo;em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesn&rsquo;t get it.) Santa Claus&rsquo;s pants.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nuh-uh! They&rsquo;re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who&rsquo;s been naughty and who&rsquo;s been nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.) Ohh.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So&mdash;Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t know! How are the-the-the-the, y&rsquo;know&mdash;You&rsquo;re clothes aren&rsquo;t funny.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uhh, a T-shirt that says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You have Knicks tickets?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, my mom got my dad&rsquo;s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, apparently, they&rsquo;re pretty good seats.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you guys want these?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah we do!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, well you got &lsquo;em.</p>
<p><b>Both:</b> All right!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just give us our apartment back!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Boy! I didn&rsquo;t see that coming!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you serious?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, what, do you think we&rsquo;re stupid?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You&rsquo;re not stupid. You&rsquo;re meaner than I thought.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What do you say?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Forget it! Okay, I&rsquo;m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You&rsquo;re bachelor pad?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Have you even had a girl up here?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you do!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey is whining to Chandler about the tickets.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Good one.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Forget it! Okay, I&rsquo;m not giving up the apartment.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh come&mdash;look, when I was a kid my dad&rsquo;s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad <b>never</b> won! Of course, he wasn&rsquo;t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We don&rsquo;t make enough fun of you already?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You do know that Wham broke up?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I like it, and Emily likes it, and that&rsquo;s what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-no, don&rsquo;t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where is Emily?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ugh, she&rsquo;s saying good-bye to her uncle.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Man, didn&rsquo;t she like just get here?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!! Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Easy tiger.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s so great. But at the same time I&rsquo;m thinking, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So what are you going to do?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Nothing! There&rsquo;s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she&rsquo;d have to uh, move here. She <b>should</b> move here!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I could ask her to live with me!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you serious?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because you&rsquo;ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I&rsquo;ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I&rsquo;ve had a longer relationship with!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look guys, when I&rsquo;m with her it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y&rsquo;know?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And I love the milk! But, I&rsquo;m not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right look, Ross, he&rsquo;s right. Emily&rsquo;s great, she&rsquo;s great! But this way too soon, you&rsquo;re only gonna scare her!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No! You don&rsquo;t want to wreck it, you don&rsquo;t want to go to fast!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, no, you&rsquo;re right, I know, you&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s erm, Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, later that same day. Joey and Chandler are eating pizza, and Phoebe is trying to knit something.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&rsquo;s too hard. Too hard!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Or I&rsquo;ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No thank you.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let&rsquo;s trade! The timing&rsquo;s perfect, I just clogged the toilet!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can&rsquo;t leave in the small apartment after we&rsquo;ve lived here! Didn&rsquo;t you ever read <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes! Didn&rsquo;t you ever read <i>Sports Illustrated</i>?! No! I didn&rsquo;t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s the Knicks!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Screw the Knicks!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I didn&rsquo;t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And the Knicks rule all.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, the Knicks rule all!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. No. We&rsquo;re not gonna do that, y&rsquo;know why? Because its not an even trade.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Done!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let me finish.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m talking about a bet, winner takes all.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, we could end up with nothing.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Or you could end up with everything.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, I like that.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, so what do you say?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, just do it!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Op, op, I&rsquo;m convinced!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on man, you know I&rsquo;d do it for you! Because, you&rsquo;re my best friend.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, but you can&rsquo;t use that again for a whole year. I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she&rsquo;s the only who&rsquo;s impartial, and she&rsquo;s so pretty.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh&mdash;oh, I have a game!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is great!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What&rsquo;s the game?! What&rsquo;s the game?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, well, it doesn&rsquo;t have a name&mdash;oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn&rsquo;t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> They&rsquo;re green?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good! Good! Five points!</p>
<p>(They both rejoice; Chandler is totally confused.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, Joey, same question.</p>
<p>(He looks to Chandler, who doesn&rsquo;t have a clue.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, they&rsquo;re tall.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.</p>
<p>(Joey turns and is angry that Chandler didn&rsquo;t come up with the answer.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s not even a game!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? Shut up! We&rsquo;re winning!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fine, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I have cards!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, good.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s a low one!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!</p>
<p>(Both Joey and Chandler and Monica and Rachel jump up and down for joy.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why are you screaming and hugging?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Because we won our apartment back!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!</p>
<p>(They all look to Phoebe to settle this.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.) Ah-ha!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, cut, let&rsquo;s pick again, pick again.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen is high!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh-huh, not as high as&hellip;(picks a card) It worked! King!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah baby!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> But, we pick again! We pick again!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Why?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&rsquo;t know!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That&rsquo;s courtside baby!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them, but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No they didn&rsquo;t!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross&rsquo;s apartment, Emily has packed as Ross returns.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (laughs) Move in with me.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Don&rsquo;t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it&rsquo;s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> My job!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, so, you-you&rsquo;ll get a job here! I mean, I&rsquo;m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Yeah, but it-it-it&rsquo;s my whole life&mdash;you come to England.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I can&rsquo;t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can&rsquo;t leave him. Isn&rsquo;t&mdash;you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any way?</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Ohh, I don&rsquo;t think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future &mdash;and-and-and we were getting married or something.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh no, no, right I shouldn&rsquo;t have said married. Uh, please don&rsquo;t go freaky on me. I didn&rsquo;t mean it. Well, I didn&rsquo;t say it; I take it back!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, don&rsquo;t. Why don&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Why don&rsquo;t we what?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Get married.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> You are mad!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! I&rsquo;m not! It&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s perfect! I mean it&rsquo;s better than you just-just moving here, &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s us together forever, and that&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s what I want.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> We&rsquo;ve only known each other for six weeks!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who&rsquo;s-who&rsquo;s to say? Does that me we-we can&rsquo;t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> My parents are going to be really mad.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Is that&mdash;are you saying yes? Is that yes?</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Yes.</p>
<p>(They kiss and hug.)</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes! We&rsquo;re getting married?!</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh my God!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> We&rsquo;re getting married!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you marry me?</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Yes.</p>
<p>(He tries to put it on her finger.)</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Ohh, it&rsquo;s a bit small.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> It was.</p>
<p>(They kiss.)</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The hallway, Joey and Chandler are coming back from the game.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Those were like the best seats ever.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y&rsquo;know, kinda like a peace offering.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s very nice. Plus, y&rsquo;know they were free and they&rsquo;re too small.</p>
<p>(He knocks on the girls&rsquo; door and walks in. Surprise! The girls, obviously using <i>Star Trek</i> technology, have completely moved everything in both apartments back to their original positions, all in the time it took for the guys to go to a basketball game. Wow! Anyhoo, Chandler is stunned, and Joey doesn&rsquo;t even realise it.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I KNOW!!!</p>
<p>(They both sprint to what used to be their apartment.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Open up! Open up! Open up!</p>
<p>(A very angry Monica opens the door with the security chain still on.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We&rsquo;ll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What the hell is going on?!</p>
<p>(It&rsquo;s Rachel&rsquo;s turn to open the door.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don&rsquo;t feel good about it.</p>
<p>(She goes to close the door, but Chandler puts his foot it in.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We are switching back, right now!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, we&rsquo;re not! We&rsquo;re not leaving!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you&rsquo;re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we&rsquo;re switching it back! There&rsquo;s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t want to move again!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t care, this is our apartment! And they stole&mdash;you stole it&mdash;our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I&rsquo;m getting back right now!</p>
<p>(They open the door.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can&rsquo;t offer anything to us!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let us keep the apartment and&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.</p>
<p>[Time lapse. The guys are entering their apartment.]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Totally worth it!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That was one good minute!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good night.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Good night.</p>
<p>(They both go back into their old rooms and shut the doors. Of course, Chandler has to close both sections of his door.)</p>
<p>[Cut to the girls apartment.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Men are such idiots.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&rsquo;s so funny to think if you&rsquo;d just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, let-let-let&rsquo;s pretend that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, scarf&rsquo;s done. (It&rsquo;s not really a scarf, it&rsquo;s just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on! Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What-what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, okay, it&rsquo;s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.</p>
<p>(The gang is stunned.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Umm, no.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> When, when did&mdash;how, how did you&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> I mean, we know it&rsquo;s a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so&hellip;</p>
<p>(Rachel slowly walks in from her bedroom. She is stunned speechless.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for Rachel&rsquo;s reaction.) I think it&rsquo;s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I&rsquo;m so happy for you!</p>
<p>(Seeing Rachel&rsquo;s apparently okay with this, the rest of the gang jumps up to congratulate Ross and Emily on their pending nuptials.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, well, that&rsquo;s great!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Ross) I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re getting married!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. (They hug again.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at him.)</p>
