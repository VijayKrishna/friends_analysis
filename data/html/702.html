<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, everyone is there having breakfast and Joey enters carrying a loaf of bread.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Who wants French toast?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;ll have some!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from her room) Oww!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What&rsquo;s the matter honey?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it&rsquo;s because, I&rsquo;m engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It starts?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, so let&rsquo;s get started on the wedding plans!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay! (Runs off.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (incredulous) Already?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I got some thoughts on that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Take it from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3&rdquo; 3-ring binder on the table.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What in God&rsquo;s name is that?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven&rsquo;t seen that since the forth grade!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> This baby has got everything. Take y&rsquo;know, locations for instance. (She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it off now.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Classroom, Ross is giving a lecture.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And <b>that</b> should conclusively prove that <b>I</b> had the idea for <i>Jurassic Park</i> first! Now let&rsquo;s take a look at&hellip; (Phoebe rushes in.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Ross!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I need to talk to you, it&rsquo;s pretty urgent. It&rsquo;s about Monica and Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other&rsquo;s hometowns? Why don&rsquo;t you&hellip; (Motions that they should learn everyone&rsquo;s hometown.) (To Phoebe) Wh-what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y&rsquo;know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what&rsquo;s wrong with Monica and Chandler?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nothing&mdash;Why?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe, you said it was urgent!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah it is! I&rsquo;m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to the students) Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Rachel and Monica are pretty much telling Chandler what the wedding plans are.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, so I haven&rsquo;t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aw.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> A jazz trio for cocktails. The <i>Bay City Rollers</i> for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you couldn&rsquo;t get them anyway. Ian doesn&rsquo;t play anymore and Derrick&hellip; (Off of Rachel and Monica&rsquo;s looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up one.) Y&rsquo;know, something a little snugglyer?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, the duck&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, well he did <b>not</b> get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually <b>involved</b> in the wedding?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Centerpieces!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just think they&rsquo;re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! It&rsquo;s like one mind.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh-huh!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You <b>gotta</b> let me nap! Ugh, I&rsquo;m gonna get cranky!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes it is perfectly good, and it is <b>not</b> one of the places the duck got sick!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I&rsquo;m gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Now Joey, what did the duck do?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know! But he did <b>not</b> eat your face cream!</p>
<p>[Cut to Joey and Rachel&rsquo;s, Joey enters and heads for his bedroom. He pushes open the door to find the duck.]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does <b>not</b> get sick and Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream? (He&rsquo;s about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachel&rsquo;s room. He walks into her room and feels the bed.) That&rsquo;s so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.) Pillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.) (In his head.) <i>Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar&hellip;</i>(Stops reading and thinks.) <i>The vicar?</i> (Continues reading) <i>&hellip;wouldn&rsquo;t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his&hellip;</i>(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! (Continues to read.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross&rsquo;s apartment, Phoebe has moved in and has a massage client on the table she&rsquo;s set up in the living room. Ross enters and is shocked to see a naked man lying on the table.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, Phoebe&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh Ross, hi.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe, what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m with a client right now.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, let&rsquo;s talk outside.</p>
<p>(They go into the hall.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe, you can&rsquo;t massage people in my apartment!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What&rsquo;s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And they knew about it?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don&rsquo;t know what the big deal is!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> The big deal is I don&rsquo;t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle&mdash;beer! Cold beer.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey and Rachel&rsquo;s, Joey is sweeping up as Rachel enters.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey Joey, what &lsquo;cha doing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Sweepin&rsquo;. Why? Turn you on?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, did <b>you</b> eat my face cream?</p>
<p>(She walks into her bedroom.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Where are you going? The vicar won&rsquo;t be home for hours.</p>
<p>(She comes back out.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (gasps) You found my book?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah I did!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, look I&rsquo;m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn&rsquo;t have, but you got porn!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey-hey, y&rsquo;know what? I don&rsquo;t care! I&rsquo;m not ashamed of my book. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little&hellip;erotica. It&rsquo;s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She goes into her room.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You got porn!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross&rsquo;s apartment, Ross is coming out of the living room carrying his salad and a puzzle&mdash;beer! Cold beer. And he decides to fold up Phoebe&rsquo;s massage table, but being Ross has trouble with it as there is a knock on the door. He sets the table back up and opens the door to reveal a beautiful woman.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hello.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> Hi, is uh Phoebe here?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh no-no, she-she&rsquo;s out for the night.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> Ohh great.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Can I, can I help you with something?</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Are you a masseur?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (deadpan) Yes I am.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> Great! (Calls down the hall) Dad! (Her old father walks in.) Thank you so much, I&rsquo;ll be back to pick him up in an hour. (She walks away.)</p>
<p>(Ross isn&rsquo;t happy and closes the door slowly.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are having dinner with her parents.</h3>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> So Chandler, your parents must&rsquo;ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, I should probably call them.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I remember when we first got engaged.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I ever heard that story.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh dad, really you don&rsquo;t need to&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> (ignoring her) Well, I&rsquo;d gotten Judy pregnant. I still don&rsquo;t know how that happened.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> (incredulous) You don&rsquo;t know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What a sweet story.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, at least you&rsquo;re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> What?! They wanted a scary story!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Anyway, we&rsquo;re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we&rsquo;ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. (She and Chandler laugh, but her parents don&rsquo;t.) What?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> You tell her Jack, I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Restaurant, scene continued from before the break.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&rsquo;t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> We&rsquo;re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you&rsquo;d pay for it yourself.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You bought the beach house when I was 23!</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can&rsquo;t put a price on that sweetie.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> We really do feel bad about this though.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What about when I started dating Chandler?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Well it was Chandler! We didn&rsquo;t think <b>he&rsquo;d</b> ever propose!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe it! That there is <b>no</b> money for my wedding?!</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> We <b>might</b> still have some money, if your father didn&rsquo;t think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> It seemed like such a simple idea.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> All right, enough! I don&rsquo;t want to hear about it anymore! (Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross&rsquo;s apartment, his massage client is on the table and Ross is reluctantly starting his massage. He spreads some lotion in his hands, and doesn&rsquo;t like it.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay! Now, I&rsquo;m going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh, that&rsquo;s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Monica and Chandler are returning from dinner, Rachel is already there.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She&rsquo;s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) <i>Dollywood</i>.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well what happened at dinner?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> My parents spent the money for our wedding!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (gasps) My God! What did you order?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wait, but there&rsquo;s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Honey, it&rsquo;s gonna be okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No! No it&rsquo;s not! It&rsquo;s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, y&rsquo;know what? It&rsquo;s gonna be okay. I mean you don&rsquo;t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y&rsquo;know? And-and you don&rsquo;t need, you don&rsquo;t need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we&rsquo;re gonna get married.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you even understand what off the rack means?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look, why don&rsquo;t you just pay for it yourself?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How? I don&rsquo;t have any money.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I have some.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How much?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, close to&hellip; (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well what?! How-how much is it?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s enough for wedding scenario eight.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is <b>exactly</b> the budget of my dream wedding!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you&rsquo;re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?</p>
<p><b>Rachel and Monica:</b> Ah, yeah!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, come on, I&rsquo;ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr. Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> This is the most special day of our lives.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I realize that honey, but I&rsquo;m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could <b>always</b> earn more money, okay? But uh, we&rsquo;re only gonna get married once.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You-you&rsquo;re gonna have to put your foot down?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, I am!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey and Ross are there as Rachel enters and sees Joey sitting there.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Rach.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (quietly) Joey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no, I&rsquo;m serious. You don&rsquo;t smell it? Something&rsquo;s on fire.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well no, I don&rsquo;t smell anything.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, y&rsquo;know what? It&rsquo;s probably just your burnin&rsquo; loins.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nothing!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (takes a drink) Damn, this coffee&rsquo;s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. (Exits.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) &lsquo;Sup?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I&rsquo;m sorry?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, so it wasn&rsquo;t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him acu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he&rsquo;s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, y&rsquo;know what? This is your fault! You&rsquo;re the one that didn&rsquo;t move his-his appointment.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s <b>my</b> fault?! You didn&rsquo;t have to massage him! You could&rsquo;ve sent him away! You could&rsquo;ve not rolled <i>Tonka</i> trucks up and down his back!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He said he liked that!! Oh you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> His daughter was hot.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Gotcha.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as Monica enters.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Listen umm, I&rsquo;ve been thinking, it&rsquo;s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ehh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Eh, you work for that.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, I thought about it too, and I&rsquo;m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You do?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you&rsquo;re so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y&rsquo;know? We&rsquo;ll pick our favorite and <b>that</b> one will get to go to college.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You thought about that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How many kids were we gonna have?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What else did you think about?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, stuff like where&rsquo;d we live, y&rsquo;know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y&rsquo;know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we&rsquo;d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) Y&rsquo;know what? I-I don&rsquo;t want a big, fancy wedding.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure you do.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You sure?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I love you so much.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin&rsquo; about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, totally!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh good.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is balancing her checkbook as Joey enters from his room wearing a hockey helmet, gloves, and shin guards.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hello, Zelda.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who are you supposed to be?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> The vicar!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you even know what a vicar is?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Like a goalie, right?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it&rsquo;s enough alright?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it&rsquo;s&mdash;I&rsquo;m not&mdash;it&rsquo;s just not funny anymore!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I&rsquo;m sorry. Rach I&mdash;Rach I&rsquo;m sorry. Okay? I&rsquo;m sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right! Y&rsquo;know what? That&rsquo;s it! You wanna do it?! Let&rsquo;s do it!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (starting to move closer to him) That&rsquo;s right, I wanna do it with you! I&rsquo;ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I&rsquo;ve been waitin&rsquo; so long to get on that body!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah that&rsquo;s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey-hey, you&rsquo;re startin&rsquo; to sound like the butcher&rsquo;s wife there in-in chapter seven.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, come on now, don&rsquo;t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you&rsquo;re in for a <b>rough</b> ride! (He backs into the door.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t want to, I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>(Rachel walks away, pleased with herself.)</p>
