<p><b>[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel, Monica, Joey, and Chandler are there.]</b></p>
<p>[Rachel brings a muffin to Chandler and Monica who are sitting on the couch.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, Chandler, Mon, there&rsquo;s only one bananna nut muffin left.</p>
<p>[Rachel holds the tray between them. Chandler grabs the muffin before Monica can.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I ordered mine first.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, but I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m so much faster&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Give it to me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Give it to me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> [She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.] There you go, enjoy your coffee.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> [enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who&rsquo;s coming to New York.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> [Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can&rsquo;t swallow the muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who&rsquo;s in the Navy.</p>
<p>[Chandler is visibly upset]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You went out with a guy in the Navy?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy &rsquo;cause he didn&rsquo;t have any change.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he&rsquo;s coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?</p>
<p>[Once again, Chandler has a bite in his mouth and can&rsquo;t come back.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;ll teach you to lick my muffin.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> [enters] Hiii.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no, what happened?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben&rsquo;s got the chicken pox.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, so if you haven&rsquo;t already had it, chances are you&rsquo;re gonna get it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Had it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Had it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I&rsquo;ve never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh look!</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Monica and Richard are in her bedroom.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don&rsquo;t have to do that. This isn&rsquo;t camp.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee&rsquo;s Leroy Brown.</p>
<p>[He walks out of the bedroom and Monica starts to remake the bed.]</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Monica&hellip; [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> What&rsquo;re you doing?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Just waiting for you sweetie.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Are you remaking the bed?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Then, you&rsquo;re redoing it because&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> If I tell you, you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m crazy.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> You&rsquo;re pretty much running that risk either way.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, you see, the tag shouldn&rsquo;t be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Oh, well that&rsquo;s not so crazy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m just easing you in.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Oh, alright.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don&rsquo;t love me any more do you.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Actually, if it&rsquo;s possible, I love you more.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s office. Joey is there.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, look Joey, I&rsquo;m just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But don&rsquo;t you need experience for a job like that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing, hey, you&rsquo;re an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you&rsquo;re a processor.</p>
<p><b>Scott:</b> [enters] Hey Chandler, here&rsquo;s this morning&rsquo;s projections.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.</p>
<p><b>Scott:</b> No kidding.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I&rsquo;m the one they call.</p>
<p><b>Scott:</b> Where do you work?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, well, right now I&rsquo;m in between things. You know how it is. One day you&rsquo;re processing, the next day you&rsquo;re not so much&hellip; processing any more.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman&rsquo;s group.</p>
<p><b>Scott:</b> Fleischman&rsquo;s group. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Monica and Rachel are doing Phoebe&rsquo;s makeup.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You look fabulous honey, you really do.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches all over her face.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I, I, I&rsquo;m hideous.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s gonna be ok. Ryan&rsquo;s been under water. He&rsquo;s just gonna be so glad that you don&rsquo;t have barnicles on your butt.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Ryan is walks up to the door and knocks.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come in.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Hey baby, I&rsquo;m back&hellip; [Phoebe is sitting by the window in a veil.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey Ryan, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> What&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Chicken or small?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I&rsquo;m a vegetarian.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Why aren&rsquo;t you at home in bed?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &rsquo;Cause my, my grandmother&rsquo;s never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, &rsquo;cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, I never had &rsquo;em.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, ohh.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn&rsquo;t have them now.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Can I please see your face?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nope. You don&rsquo;t want to see a face covered with pox.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And you hate fish. Oh. That&rsquo;s so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me&hellip; [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in terror.] Oh, I am scary.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I hate this. &rsquo;Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. [He walks to her and kisses her.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, this is the most romantic disease I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s office. Joey enters.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, how&rsquo;s the first day goin&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Pretty good. It&rsquo;s like you said. It&rsquo;s mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well there you go.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Weird world. Your kids?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I figure my character has kids.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ya know there isn&rsquo;t a part of that sentence I don&rsquo;t need explained.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, see when you&rsquo;re acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid&hellip; Ya know what? Just did.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really? Wow. That&rsquo;s some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Phoebe and Ryan are playing Monopoly.</h3>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> You know what makes the itching even worse?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That you don&rsquo;t stop talking about it.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Fine.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Let&rsquo;s just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes, here we go&hellip; [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> What&rsquo;re you doing? Are you scratching?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. This is what I do for luck, ok.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> You&rsquo;re scratching. Give me the dice.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Give me the dice.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> We can&rsquo;t scratch. You know we can&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll scar.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uhh, I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it. It&rsquo;s just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub &rsquo;em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Give it.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let&rsquo;s just be bad, it&rsquo;ll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Oh God help me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.</p>
<p>[They get back to back and start rubbing against each other. Ross and Rachel enter.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, stop that, stop that right now.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you&rsquo;re a military man.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s office building. Joey and Jeannie are talking.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen&rsquo;ll pack a lunch, you&rsquo;ll bring the kids, we&rsquo;ll make a day of it.</p>
<p><b>Jeannie:</b> Oh, that sounds lovely. We&rsquo;re gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.</p>
<p><b>Jeannie:</b> Bye bye Joey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What a phony.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Sir.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Douglas:</b> Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we&rsquo;re not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Douglas:</b> I have a family, I&rsquo;m gonna be here.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah Bing, what&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Douglas:</b> Rough numbers?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Douglas:</b> Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, if you say so sir.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Joseph&rsquo;s good, isn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m going to kill you.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph&rsquo;s the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, I&rsquo;m sorry but that&rsquo;s what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin&rsquo;, he&rsquo;ll call you on it. &lsquo;What&rsquo;re you tryin&rsquo; to pull,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Monica enters her bedroom with a roll of duct tape. Richard is sitting on the bed.</h3>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> You&rsquo;re strict.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s for their own good.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don&rsquo;t you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> If it&rsquo;s not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Very good.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know what. Tomorrow I&rsquo;m gonna do your clocks.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> You&rsquo;re gonna do what to my clocks.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m gonna set them to my time.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m confused. I thought we shared time.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Because it&rsquo;s in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No forget it, I&rsquo;m not gonna tell you now.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> No come on. Come on tell me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No. See you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Come on.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No. You don&rsquo;t have any of these cute little obsessive things.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> No that&rsquo;s not true. That is not true.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, well tell me one of yours.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What if they get mixed up?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You would not. I can&rsquo;t believe this. I hate this, you&rsquo;re too normal. I can&rsquo;t believe my boyfriend doesn&rsquo;t have a thing. My boyfriend doesn&rsquo;t have a thing.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> See, if anyone overheard that, I didn&rsquo;t come off well.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s office. Chandler is asleep in his chair holding a paper in one hand and a pen in the other. Joey walks in, waking up Chandler who covers by pretending to write on the paper.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &rsquo;Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, that&rsquo;s it. Look Joey, I&rsquo;m sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that&rsquo;s not possible so I&rsquo;m gonna have to let both of you go.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What&rsquo;re you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he&rsquo;s a brown-nosing suck up.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah. Well you can&rsquo;t fire Joseph. You know why, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s not in your department.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, ok, alright. So I can&rsquo;t fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Karen.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, Karen. I&rsquo;m thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh well it&rsquo;s not me, it&rsquo;s my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker&rsquo;s wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No freakshow, she&rsquo;s fictional.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I&rsquo;ll uh, I&rsquo;ll go find something else.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s just that, I, I&rsquo;m gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. [Chadler pushes him out the door by the face.]</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Rachel and Ross are in the kitchen. Phoebe is sitting at the couch with oven mits on her hands.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Can I please take these off? I swear I won&rsquo;t scratch.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No sorry hon, Monica&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> [Comes out of the bathroom, also with oven mits on his hands.] Well that wasn&rsquo;t easy.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, dinner&rsquo;s on.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And there&rsquo;s a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate&rsquo;s gonna be hot but that shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright you kids, bye now.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe &amp; Ryan:</b> Bye. [waving]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh look, a low budget puppet show.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s such a shame you can&rsquo;t see which finger I&rsquo;m holding up.</p>
<p>[Ross and Rachel leave.]</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Wine?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Please. [Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe&rsquo;s mits.]</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Oh, I spilled some.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I got it. [Wipes it up with her mits.]</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> [Puts his hands over Phoebe&rsquo;s ears.] I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Sorry. You look beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>
<p>[They start to kiss. They try to get each other&rsquo;s shirts off but can&rsquo;t get the buttons undone.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know what, that&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it. [She rips off the mits, Ryan follows her lead.]</p>
<p>[They keep kissing and start scratching each other. Ross enters, takes one look, and goes right back out the door.]</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Richard and Monica are in bed.</h3>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Monica, wake up. Monica.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> I thought of a thing.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Or so I would have you believe.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Hey come on, you haven&rsquo;t heard my reason yet.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, go on.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, you&rsquo;re a freak.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Yeah. How &lsquo;bout that.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk. Phoebe, Rachel, Ross, and Ryan are there. Ryan is in uniform, getting ready to leave.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> I really can&rsquo;t say.</p>

<p><b>Ryan:</b> I can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow, it, it&rsquo;s neat learning about submarines.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> I better get out of here, I&rsquo;m gonna miss my flight.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, I&rsquo;ll walk you out.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Bye Ryan.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Pleasure.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It was nice to meet you.</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Take care.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know. We didn&rsquo;t do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. [They kiss.]</p>
<p><b>Ryan:</b> Taxi.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Bye you. [Ryan&rsquo;s cab drives off. As Phoebe is going back in, she sees the Central Perk sign in the window and laughs.]</p>
