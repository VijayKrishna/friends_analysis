<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, the gang is there, Phoebe is returning from the bathroom.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (angrily) That&rsquo;s like the tenth time I&rsquo;ve peed since I&rsquo;ve been here!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s also like the tenth time you told us.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, oh I&rsquo;m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it&rsquo;s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I&rsquo;m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, &lsquo;cause&mdash;Oh! I&rsquo;m pregnant!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, did&hellip;you want a cookie?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (starting to cry) Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I haven&rsquo;t really had any yet.</p>
<p>(Monica, Joey, and Chandler all shake their heads.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey guys!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, here&rsquo;s the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans on giving Emily)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don&rsquo;t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s awkward. It&rsquo;s awkward. It&rsquo;s awkward.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I sort&rsquo;ve already asked Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey, I figured you&rsquo;d understand. I mean, I-I&rsquo;ve known him a lot longer.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on Ross! Look, I-I don&rsquo;t have any brothers; I&rsquo;ll never get to be a best man!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can be the best man when I get married.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (pause) I&rsquo;ll never get to be a best man!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no, you&mdash;yeah, of course you get to be my best man.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you just said I could!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re not picking me.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, how can it <b>not</b> be me?!HeyHey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m not even&hellip; I&rsquo;m not even&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine, y&rsquo;know what, that&rsquo;s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes! (to Chandler) Shame about you man.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are eating breakfast.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to her babies) Stop it!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> One of the babies is kicking.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I thought that was a good thing.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s not kicking me, it&rsquo;s kicking one of the other babies. Oh (looks down her dress)! Don&rsquo;t make me come in there!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooo, later. (Walks out the door.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in, scared.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hormones!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you&rsquo;re having a party and we&rsquo;re not invited?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s Ross&rsquo;s bachelor party.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Sooo?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you bachelors?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nooo!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you strippers?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nooo!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Then you&rsquo;re not invited. (Starts for the door again.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right fine! You&rsquo;re not invited to the party we&rsquo;re gonna have either.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-whoa, what party?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well umm&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> The baby shower for Phoebe!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don&rsquo;t want to do! Later! (Finally, he makes his exit.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m gonna have a party! This is so great! (Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and Rachel moves to comfort her.) I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey and Ross are talking over party plans.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> This is what I&rsquo;ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Great. Great.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I&rsquo;ve got you, me, and Chandler and I&rsquo;m gonna invite Gunther &lsquo;cause, well, we&rsquo;ve been talking about this pretty loud.</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> I&rsquo;ll be there.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right&mdash;oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I&rsquo;d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Tell ya what, let&rsquo;s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay! We&rsquo;ll need a six-pack of <i>Zima</i>.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey guys, what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, see, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna that difficult considering this one <b>won&rsquo;t</b> be taking place in the basement of a <i>Pizza Hut</i>.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m Ross. I&rsquo;m Ross. I&rsquo;m too good for the Hut; I&rsquo;m too good for the Hut.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You got it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, see ya later.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.) Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, there&rsquo;s gonna be strippers there. He didn&rsquo;t say anything about no strippers.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> He just said, &ldquo;No strippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I chose not to hear that.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica is returning from shopping and Rachel is there.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Little village people.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (It&rsquo;s a little pink and white dress for the girl baby.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, that is so sweet!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh. Except, Phoebe&rsquo;s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Because she&rsquo;s not gonna get to keep the babies.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she&rsquo;s done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she&rsquo;s always wanted!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, she&rsquo;s gonna love that!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Phoebe&rsquo;s baby shower, she is holding those leather pants, and isn&rsquo;t happy about it.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can&rsquo;t use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what&rsquo;s my next present?!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> I don&rsquo;t have anything. (All of the rest of the women there hide their gifts behind their backs.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Ross&rsquo;s bachelor party. Ross is thanking Joey for the party.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey listen man, about the stripper&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Good call!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I&rsquo;ve decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> What&rsquo;s my last name?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Central Perk?</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> (to Ross) Thanks for not marrying Rachel. (He starts to leave.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don&rsquo;t-don&rsquo;t forget your shirt. (He gives Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey-hey, what are those?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, little party favours, check it out! (It&rsquo;s a shirt that reads, &ldquo;Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998&rdquo;)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-oh! (Shows him what&rsquo;s on the back, &ldquo;Best Man Joey Tribbiani, with a huge picture of him.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Great!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, hey, don&rsquo;t forget your shirt.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, hey, museum geeks, party&rsquo;s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent&rsquo;s basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Wow, I didn&rsquo;t know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck complies.)</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin&rsquo; ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday&hellip;</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. I&rsquo;ll let you play with my duck.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey&rsquo;s bedroom, it&rsquo;s the middle of the night, he&rsquo;s waking up and discovers he&rsquo;s alone in bed.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, (realises he doesn&rsquo;t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it&rsquo;s empty and starts to panic.)</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s continued from earlier. Joey is now waking Chandler and telling him the news.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (running and banging on Chandler&rsquo;s door) The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (opening the door) What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> The ring is gone!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this&mdash;Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You&rsquo;re the worst best man ever!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, this isn&rsquo;t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything&rsquo;s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper&rsquo;s gone and the ring is gone!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You slept with the stripper?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Of course!! (Shrugs.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Phoebe is entering, Monica and Rachel are talking on the couch.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi, guys.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe&rsquo;s way.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I-I wanted to apologise if I&mdash;y&rsquo;know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y&rsquo;know it&rsquo;s just the hormones, y&rsquo;know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No we&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hormones.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> &hellip;hormones, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. (She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That&rsquo;s great. So how-how are things going?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good. Y&rsquo;know&mdash;no-no, okay, it&rsquo;s-it feels like everything&rsquo;s been about me lately, so what&rsquo;s happening with you?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It just might be too hard, given the history and all that&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, h-how is this like that?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, let&rsquo;s see, it&rsquo;s not. Really, like that. Because, you see <b>that</b> was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y&rsquo;know a bunch of y&rsquo;know high school crap that nobody really gives y&rsquo;know&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (starting to cry) I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m sorry, I just thought that&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is trying to figure out what to do.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ugh! I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don&rsquo;t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn&rsquo;t an emergency, then what is?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey guys!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y&rsquo;know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that&rsquo;s nice!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, right!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you might say, it&rsquo;s a magic ring.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I think it all started when you said, &ldquo;Hey Joey, why don&rsquo;t you be my best man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I&rsquo;m gonna call the cops!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, I screwed up, you don&rsquo;t have to turn me in!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Not on you! On the stripper!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they&rsquo;re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, well, we&rsquo;ll call the company that sent her!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I did that too! They wouldn&rsquo;t give me her real name or her number. They said, &ldquo;If I bothered them again they&rsquo;d call the police.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;If you talk to the police, you tell them I&rsquo;m missing a ring!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there&rsquo;s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, that sounds like fun, but we&rsquo;ve got a ring to find!!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica and Rachel are cautiously serving Phoebe some tea.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Here&rsquo;s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a step back.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sips it) It&rsquo;s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of relief.) Oh, thanks.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m so glad you liked it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You what?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was <b>definitely</b> one.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, you can&rsquo;t have the baby here! I mean I haven&rsquo;t sterilised it since the guys moved out!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. It&rsquo;s okay. We&rsquo;re gonna be okay. Y&rsquo;know what? It&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m gonna, I&rsquo;m gonna, I&rsquo;m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. It&rsquo;s all right; it&rsquo;s probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, get the book! The book!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> The Bible?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t know!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s office, the guys are there waiting to ambush the stripper.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won&rsquo;t recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I&rsquo;ll be uh, Mr. Wong.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Diverse.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s a knock on the door.)</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Did anybody call for security?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.) Hey, Joey?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Where&rsquo;s my ring? My dead grandmother&rsquo;s wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Way to be cool, man.</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> What&rsquo;s he talking about?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?</p>
<p><b>The Guys:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!</p>
<p><b>The Stripper:</b> Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don&rsquo;t need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, the guys are now trying to figure out what next to do, since their plan with the stripper backfired on them.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn&rsquo;t take it, and I didn&rsquo;t take it; and you (Chandler) didn&rsquo;t take it, then who did? (The duck quacks.) Shh! We&rsquo;re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at Joey, who doesn&rsquo;t get it. After a short pause, with the duck still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Phoebe is recovering from her false labour.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I still don&rsquo;t get how you know when it&rsquo;s false labour.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, do you <b>see</b> any babies?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How do you feel?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I guess. I mean&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s just, I guess I know it&rsquo;s going to be over soon.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, isn&rsquo;t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know. It&rsquo;s just y&rsquo;know usually when you&rsquo;re, when you&rsquo;re done with the pregnant thing, y&rsquo;know, then you get to do the mom thing. I&rsquo;m gonna be y&rsquo;know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Some moms do that.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay that&rsquo;s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it&rsquo;s just that now that they&rsquo;re in me it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like I know them y&rsquo;know, I mean-I mean, it&rsquo;s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Aww, sweetie, but it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re not gonna have anything. You&rsquo;re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that&rsquo;s even better.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, really. Really, Pheebs, you&rsquo;re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they&rsquo;re bad, y&rsquo;know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won&rsquo;t calm down. Y&rsquo;know?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean, you&rsquo;re the one they&rsquo;re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And y&rsquo;know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> They are gonna love me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks you guys! Again.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You&rsquo;re the best. Thanks. Oh!</p>
<p><b>Monica and Rachel:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Just kidding. Ahh!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Got cha again, you guys are so easy.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Animal Hospital, the guys have taken the duck in to remove the ring. Joey is pacing around like an expectant father.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> If anything should happen to him&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey! The vet said it&rsquo;s a simple procedure.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So! Things can go wrong! You don&rsquo;t know! What if he doesn&rsquo;t make it?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> He will, Joe.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, but what if he doesn&rsquo;t? He&rsquo;s such a good duck.</p>
<p>(With that we go into a little flashback about the guys&rsquo; memories of the duck. The first one is Joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off. Then it&rsquo;s Chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and Chandler reading to him in bed, and him watching <i>Baywatch</i> when all they had was the canoe and the duck was in a bucket of water. Then we see Ross eating some cereal and the duck watching him. He takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. Then it&rsquo;s Chandler shooing them out of the bathroom in the girls&rsquo; apartment, Joey revealing their disco cubby hole in the entertainment-center, then Chandler playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with them, and it&rsquo;s concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping it&rsquo;s wings. And the guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m so worried about him, y&rsquo;know?</p>
<p><b>The Doctor:</b> (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where it&rsquo;s been.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> H-h-h-how&rsquo;s the duck?</p>
<p><b>The Doctor:</b> He&rsquo;s doing just fine, he&rsquo;s resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, that&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, it&rsquo;s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, come on, it&rsquo;s not your fault.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, it is! You wouldn&rsquo;t have lost the ring, right? Y&rsquo;know what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, you should.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Now, don&rsquo;t argue with me&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! Hey! Hey! <b>I</b> get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my&hellip; I mean, I&rsquo;m lucky to have just one good&hellip; (They all start getting emotional.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks man.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so that they can&rsquo;t see him cry.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What a baby.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Total wuss!</p>
<p>(They both turn and wipe their eyes.)</p>
