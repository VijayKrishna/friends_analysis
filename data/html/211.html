<h3><b>Scene:</b> at Ross&rsquo;s. Carol and Susan are picking Ben up</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok. Here&rsquo;s his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh&hellip;oh, him. Hi!</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> So how did everything go?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Well, we&rsquo;ve gotta go.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> <i>[clears her throat]</i></p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh, right. Um, I&rsquo;ve got some news. It&rsquo;s about us.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you and me?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Uh, no, Susan and me.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> The other us.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> We&rsquo;re uh, we&rsquo;re getting married.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> As in, &ldquo;I now pronounce you wife and wife&rdquo; married?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Anyway, we&rsquo;d like you to come, but we totally understand if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why wouldn&rsquo;t I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Look I just thought that&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn&rsquo;t I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn&rsquo;t revel in your joy? I&rsquo;m revelling baby, believe me!</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Is your finger caught in that chair?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Mmm hmmm.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Want us to go?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> at Rachel and Monica&rsquo;s</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> This is so cool. You&rsquo;re actually gonna be on television.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It really hit me last night. I&rsquo;m gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin&rsquo; about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes! Carol and Susan&rsquo;s caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she&rsquo;s in a full body cast.</p>
<p><b>Ross, Chandler &amp; Joey:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I&rsquo;ve never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn&rsquo;t a problem for you, is it?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Would it matter?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you are so great! <i>[kisses him]</i> Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you really not going?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I am really not going. I don&rsquo;t get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> If you wanna call that a reason.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>[singing to the tune of Mister Rogers&rsquo; Neighborhood]</i> Who&rsquo;s the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, I thought you were over this.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She&rsquo;s my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you&rsquo;d expect me to be there.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she&rsquo;d be like the worst lesbian ever.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>[entering hurriedly]</i> Did I miss it? Did I miss it?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I&rsquo;m on right after this guy shoots himself.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa, she&rsquo;s pretty.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, and she&rsquo;s really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, what?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, ok.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> There&rsquo;s my scene, there&rsquo;s my scene. <i>[Joey on tv]</i> &ldquo;Mrs. Wallace, I&rsquo;m Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister&rsquo;s neurosurgeon.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Wallace:</b> Is she gonna be all right?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nice!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s great!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Excellent!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin&rsquo; to smell something.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That is so good! Do it again!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, all right. &ldquo;Damnit Braverman, it&rsquo;s right there on the chart!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No no, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, hello.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, thanks. I couldn&rsquo;t uh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Is everything ok?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my god.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s a little more relaxed than you want them to get.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, honey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, &ldquo;ok, I&rsquo;ll have some breakfast, and then I&rsquo;ll take a little walk, and then I&rsquo;ll have my massage.&rdquo; Little did she know God was thinking, &ldquo;Ok, but that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don&rsquo;t think it went very far.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think it went into me.</p>
<p><i>[Everyone takes a step back from Phoebe]</i></p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> God, this is so hard. I can&rsquo;t decide between lamb or duck.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would&rsquo;ve been called Silence of the Ducks.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, who ordered what?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh god.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re so uptight about your mom comin&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, but it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s the first time, and I just don&rsquo;t want her to think that because I didn&rsquo;t marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>[Mrs. Adelman&rsquo;s voice]</i> Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady&rsquo;ll be with us?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. <i>[Mrs. Adelman&rsquo;s voice]</i> Sit up!</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> <i>[entering]</i> There she is.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mom!</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it&rsquo;s wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that&rsquo;s the fun.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pretty much.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> Oh hello, Ross.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi, Mrs. Green. <i>[He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.]</i></p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh Mom!</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> If you didn&rsquo;t pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Believe me, sometimes that happens.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father&rsquo;s house to the sorority house to my husband&rsquo;s house. I am just so proud of you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. &rsquo;Course, that&rsquo;s before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs, who&rsquo;s Evelyn Dermer?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. Who&rsquo;s Soupy Sales?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> at Rachel and Monica&rsquo;s</h3>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> Oh my god, there&rsquo;s an unattractive nude man playing the cello.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well just be glad he&rsquo;s not playing a smaller instrument.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> <i>[laughing]</i> You have some life here, sweetie.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn&rsquo;t marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> I do. You didn&rsquo;t love Barry. And I&rsquo;ve never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> For&hellip;me.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> Well, not just for you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> I&rsquo;m uh, considering leaving your father.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> <i>[entering]</i> All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh god. I think I&rsquo;m gonna be sick.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why? It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m putting little nipples on them.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And you had no idea they weren&rsquo;t getting along?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> None.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> They didn&rsquo;t fight a lot?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! They didn&rsquo;t even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>[Mrs. Adelman&rsquo;s voice]</i> In my day, divorce was not an option.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, look who&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I just can&rsquo;t believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody&rsquo;s parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about this.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she&rsquo;s doing it because she wants to be more like you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, then, you know, couldn&rsquo;t she have just copied my haircut?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, it&rsquo;s funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it&rsquo;s actually kinda true.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&rsquo;s him.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn&rsquo;t come yet.</p>
<p><b>Mr. A:</b> Phoebe?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.</p>
<p><b>Mr. A:</b> Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, do you wanna sit?</p>
<p><b>Mr. A:</b> Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t know how to say this, but I think when your wife&rsquo;s spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.</p>
<p><b>Mr. A:</b> You&rsquo;re saying, my wife is in you?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Ok, you don&rsquo;t have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she&rsquo;d be hanging around?</p>
<p><b>Mr. A:</b> Well, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Everything?</p>
<p><b>Mr. A:</b> Everything.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Whoa, that&rsquo;s a lot of stuff.</p>
<p><b>Mr. A:</b> Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, there&rsquo;s laughing in my head.</p>
<p><b>Mr. A:</b> <i>[to Joey]</i> Worth a shot, huh?</p>
<p><i>[Joey nods and shrugs.]</i></p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> Look at this.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> These are from Halloween three years ago.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> Oh, look, here&rsquo;s Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, that was his costume. See, he&rsquo;s actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Um, you guys, you know when I said before, &ldquo;thank you, but I don&rsquo;t really need your help&rdquo;?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Actually, what I think you said was, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don&rsquo;t think I planned enough time to actually do it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Mon, you want some help?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> If you want.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>[enters]</i> Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> She&rsquo;s still with you?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. I guess she hasn&rsquo;t seen everything yet. I&rsquo;ll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. <i>[Takes Mrs. Green&rsquo;s chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman&rsquo;s voice]</i> Oh, such a pretty face.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> God!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, look, nobody&rsquo;s smoking pot around all this food.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> That&rsquo;s fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what&rsquo;s new in sex?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! What&rsquo;s new in sex?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> The only man I&rsquo;ve ever been with is your father.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m dicing, I&rsquo;m dicing, I don&rsquo;t hear anything.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You want me to talk you out of it?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Then what? What do you want?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why on earth would I understand this?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> You didn&rsquo;t marry your Barry. I did.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right people, we&rsquo;re in trouble here. We&rsquo;ve only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, speed it up!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s the pigs. they&rsquo;re reluctant to get in the blankets!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sir! No sir!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> <i>[to Ross]</i> All right, you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don&rsquo;t help me cook, I&rsquo;m gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I&rsquo;m gonna create a new appetizer called &ldquo;pigs in Ross&rdquo;. All right, ball the melon.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! How come I&rsquo;m stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.</p>
<p><i>[knock at the door]</i></p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> How&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.<i>[everyone groans]</i></p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Fine, whatever.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we&rsquo;re calling off the wedding.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You&rsquo;re still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Carol, what&rsquo;s the matter? What happened?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> My parents called this afternoon to say they weren&rsquo;t coming.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my god.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they&rsquo;re my parents. They&rsquo;re supposed to give me away and everything.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren&rsquo;t doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn&rsquo;t see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I uh can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m gonna say this, but I think Susan&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> You do?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, do you love her? And you don&rsquo;t have to be too emphatic about this.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Of course I do.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well then that&rsquo;s it. And if George and Adelaide can&rsquo;t accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn&rsquo;t want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> You&rsquo;re right. Of course you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So we&rsquo;re back on?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> We&rsquo;re back on.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can&rsquo;t believe I lost 2 minutes.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> at the wedding</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.</p>
<p><i>[Wedding music starts, Phoebe noisily unwraps a piece of candy.]</i></p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>[Mrs. Adelman&rsquo;s voice]</i> Butterscotch? No one? All right, you&rsquo;ll be sorry later.</p>
<p><i>[Monica pushes Ben down the aisle in a stroller. Susan is escorted by both her parents. Carol is escorted by Ross.]</i></p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Any time. <i>[He doesn&rsquo;t want to let her go]</i></p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Ross. <i>[He lets her go]</i></p>
<p><b>Minister:</b> You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we&rsquo;re gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>[Mrs. Adelman&rsquo;s voice]</i> Oh my god. Now I&rsquo;ve seen everything! <i>[Phoebe&rsquo;s voice]</i> Whoa, she&rsquo;s gone. She&rsquo;s gone. She&rsquo;s gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.</p>
<p><i>[At the reception, Monica and Ross watch Carol and Susan getting their picture taken.]</i></p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Would you look at them?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, can&rsquo;t help but.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> <i>[to a wedding guest]</i> How&rsquo;s that pig-in-the-blanket workin&rsquo; out for you? <i>[the guy nods]</i> I wrapped those bad boys.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I miss Rose.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know it&rsquo;s kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> You know, I uh, I couldn&rsquo;t help but overhear what you just said, and I think it&rsquo;s time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life&hellip;how &lsquo;bout we go get you a drink?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, that&rsquo;s so nice.</p>
<p><i>[Chandler tries to warn Phoebe that the woman is coming on to her, but Phoebe doesn&rsquo;t see him.]</i></p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>[to an attractive woman]</i> I shouldn&rsquo;t even bother coming up with a line, right? <i>[The woman walks away]</i></p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Mom? Having fun?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Green:</b> Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s something I wanna pursue, but it&rsquo;s nice to know I have options.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> There&rsquo;s more alcohol, right?</p>
<p><i>[Susan approaches Ross, who&rsquo;s looking lonely]</i></p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> How you doin&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> You did a good thing today.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> You wanna dance?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Come on. I&rsquo;ll let you lead.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><i>[They dance; Carol looks on lovingly.]</i></p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> <i>[to the woman who just rejected him]</i> All right look. Penis schmenis. We&rsquo;re all people. <i>[She walks away again.]</i></p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> at Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, Mon, I was married.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, me, too, technically.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I had a wedding.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? <i>[They all look at Chandler]</i></p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Isn&rsquo;t Ben in this?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh, yeah!</p>
