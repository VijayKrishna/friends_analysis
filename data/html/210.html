<p>[The gang is walking to a newsstand late at night. Joey is anxiously in the lead.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, would you slow down? They&rsquo;re not gonna be sold out of papers at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m excited! I&rsquo;ve never gotten reviewed before.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your&hellip; royal subject.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] <i>The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani&rsquo;s disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.</i></p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK, look, that is one guy&rsquo;s opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK. [reading] <i>The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction&hellip;</i></p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Does anyone have one from a <b>different</b> paper? Ross, read yours.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, honey, they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe they do. I&rsquo;ve been doin&rsquo; this ten years and I haven&rsquo;t gotten anywhere. There&rsquo;s gotta be a reason.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh c&rsquo;mon. Maybe you&rsquo;re just, uhhh&hellip; paying your dues.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, no, it.. it&rsquo;s too hard. It&rsquo;s not worth it. I quit.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe <b>this</b> will change your mind. [Reads from paper] <i>In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of&hellip;</i> continued on page 153&hellip;[turns it] <i>sucking.</i></p>

<p>[Ross enters, depressed.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> [sullenly] Hiiiiii.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Are&hellip; are you OK?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th&mdash;Fun Bobby&rsquo;s jacket! Where is he, what. He, he&rsquo;s here, isn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Maybe.</p>

<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Geller!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, Fun Bobby!</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Hey. Whoa, hey, you&rsquo;ve been working out, huh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you&rsquo;re back with my sister!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You and me both.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Hey, so what&rsquo;d I miss, what&rsquo;d I miss, c&rsquo;mon?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Hey, do you need me to pick you up?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I&rsquo;m alright man. Really.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> No, I&rsquo;m picking you up.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey no, seriously, I don&rsquo;t need you to pick me&hellip; [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? [everyone raises their hands] I&rsquo;m still gonna go.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> OK, I&rsquo;ll see you later babe.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes. [kisses Monica]</p>
<p>[Chandler and Joey are watching, Rachel turns their heads away from Monica.]</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> See ya. [exits]</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Bye! See you later!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fun Bobby is so great.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, isn&rsquo;t he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I&rsquo;ve been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Half full of <b>looooovvvvve</b>.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And for our two-week anniversary, he&rsquo;s gonna take me to his cousin&rsquo;s cabin for the weekend.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Cabin of <b>loooooovvvvve</b>.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> We went through a <b>lot</b> of wine tonight, you guys. [walks over to table, holding five empty wine bottles]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really? I only had two glasses.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I just had a glass.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Two.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I had one glass.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I had about a mugful in this lovely &lsquo;I got boned at the Museum of Natural History&rsquo; mug.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, so that&rsquo;s&hellip; that&rsquo;s what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oooooh.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> [realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So what. So he drank a lot tonight.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen Fun Bobby without a&hellip; a drink in his hand.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, &lsquo;I was soooo wasted,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Oh, we were soooo bombed,&rsquo; or, ummm, ooh, ooh, &rsquo;so I wake up, and I&rsquo;m in this dumpster in Connecticut.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Monica, have you ever been with him when he <b>wasn&rsquo;t</b> drinking?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or&hellip; or to a club, or to the&hellip; zoo.</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: Monica, Fun Bobby, and Phoebe sitting in <i>Central Perk</i> Rachel is serving them. She brings a mug to Monica.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, does this have nonfat milk?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ehhhummmm, I don&rsquo;t know, why don&rsquo;t you taste it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> [takes a sip] Mmmm, no.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> [pulls out a flask] Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?</p>
<p>[Phoebe and Rachel look uncomfortable.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, cake.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna&hellip; we&rsquo;re gonna get some cake. [Phoebe and Rachel go to counter.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know what? It seems like you&rsquo;ve been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Bobby.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Yeah, OK.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; but, uh, I&rsquo;m kind of worried about you.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> OK, look, this isn&rsquo;t the first time somebody&rsquo;s said something to me about this, but, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I always made excuses about it, like&hellip; uhhh&hellip; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m just a social drinker,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;C&rsquo;mon, it&rsquo;s Flag Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So, what are you saying now?</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> I guess I&rsquo;m saying, I&rsquo;ll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. [they hug]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> [comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on, huh?</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> I am gonna try and quit drinking.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Guess who&rsquo;s back in show business.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, no.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but&hellip; Joey, that&rsquo;s who.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for <i>Days of Our Lives</i>!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, yeah&hellip; we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We&rsquo;re all gonna do something tonight.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ummmm&hellip; well, actually I&rsquo;m already done, but I&hellip;I kinda got plans.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> [gasps] You have other friends?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah&hellip; I, uhh&hellip; I have a&hellip; I have a date.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> With a man?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? What is so strange about me having a date?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noooo, no, I&rsquo;m not mad at him. I&rsquo;m.. I&rsquo;m not really <b>anything</b> at him anymore.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. Whatever I was feeling, I&rsquo;m&hellip; not.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But you guys came so close.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I know, I&rsquo;m sorry you guys. You&rsquo;re just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.</p>
<p>[Russ enters <i>Central Perk</i>. He looks like Ross, except for his chin and hair (it is David Schwimmer in a dual role).]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> [sounding like Ross] Hhhhiiiii.</p>
<p>[Everyone looks at each other in amazement.]</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: <i>Estelle Leonard Talent Agency</i>. Estelle (ESTL) is speaking on the phone.]</p>
<p>ESTL: Stop saying you&rsquo;re not talented, you&rsquo;re very talented. It&rsquo;s just with the bird dead and all, there&rsquo;s very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? [a knock on the door] Oooh, ooh, I&rsquo;ll talk to you later.</p>
<p>[Joey enters.]</p>
<p>ESTL: Well, there&rsquo;s my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.</p>
<p>ESTL: Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No.</p>
<p>ESTL: Well, here it is. [She almost smiles.]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> OK, uh&hellip; listen, there&rsquo;s something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady&hellip;</p>
<p>ESTL: Oh, isn&rsquo;t Lori a doll?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, yeah, she&rsquo;s great, but&hellip; I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of&hellip; coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would&rsquo;ve&hellip; you know&hellip; if I would have sent the Little General in.</p>
<p>ESTL: Oh, I see. Well, I&rsquo;m just gonna put in a call here and we&rsquo;ll find out what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on and straighten it out. [picks up the phone] Yeah, hi, Lori please. [pause] Hi darling. So how &lsquo;bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn&rsquo;t he terrific? [pause] Uh-huuuuh. [pause] Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. [hangs up] [to Joey] Yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna have to sleep with her.</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: <i>Central Perk</i>. Monica and Rachel at counter, Phoebe, Chandler, and Fun Bobby at the couch.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s Fun Bobby.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What, isn&rsquo;t he sober?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, he&rsquo;s sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhh, OK.</p>
<p>[Monica returns to couch next to Fun Bobby.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God, yes!</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That <b>is</b> funny.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I&rsquo;m out walkin&rsquo; around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ahhh, hey honey? Don&rsquo;t you have to be at your interview now?</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Oh yeah. See you guys. [leaves]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye&hellip; ridiculously dull Bobby.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh&hellip; my&hellip; God.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Not that bad? Did you <b>hear</b> the hammer story?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, OK, don&rsquo;t get all squinky.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> But I&rsquo;m gonna be there&hellip; for the rest of my life. I mean, I can&rsquo;t break up with him. I&rsquo;m the one who made him quit drinking. He&rsquo;s dull because of me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Alright, don&rsquo;t say that. He&rsquo;s probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.</p>
<p>[Russ enters, walking in behind Chandler.]</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> [turning around] Hey Ross&hellip; bahhhh!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi Russ, I&rsquo;ve just got two more tables to clean and then we&rsquo;ll go, OK?</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> OK, I&rsquo;ll just sit here and&hellip; uh&hellip; chat with your, uh&hellip; friend-type&hellip;people.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Rachel? Um, hi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, so, you know what you&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uhh&hellip; waitressing?</p>

<p><b>Russ:</b> Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel&rsquo;s?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel&rsquo;s?</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> Actually, I&rsquo;m a&hellip; kind of a&hellip; you know, a&hellip; date-type&hellip; thing&hellip; of Rachel&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, oh, you&rsquo;re&hellip; uh&hellip; you&rsquo;re, oh <b>you&rsquo;re</b> the date.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, yes I am. And you are a&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> Periodontist.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> See? They&rsquo;re as different as night and&hellip; later that night.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I didn&rsquo;t know we were, uh, seeing other people.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, uh, for your information, there&rsquo;s a woman at the museum, who&rsquo;s curator of moths and other&hellip; uh&hellip; winged things&hellip; who&rsquo;s, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a&hellip; well, you know. But so far I&rsquo;ve been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, yeah, this is the deal.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> OK, well, um, have a nice evening.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, yes, but did you see <b>who</b> she was dating?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you not see it?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> See what? I don&rsquo;t know what she sees in&hellip; innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like&hellip; like&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, uhh&hellip; uhhh, hello&hellip; a&hellip; week, to get out a sentence.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s annoying, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s apartment. Joey is making marinara sauce and filling every container in sight. Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa, whoa, so I&rsquo;m guessing you didn&rsquo;t get the part, or&hellip; uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, the part&rsquo;s mine if I want it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, if I&rsquo;m willing to sleep with the casting lady.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> [not knowing how to react] Oh my&hellip; God?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ten years I&rsquo;ve been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, <i>Days of Our Lives</i>. That&rsquo;s actually on television.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, what&rsquo;re you gonna do?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I guess I could sleep with her&hellip; I mean, how could I do that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;ve never slept with someone for a part.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well is she&hellip; [reaches into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out, covered with pasta sauce]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s alright. Is she good-looking?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, she&rsquo;s totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I&rsquo;d be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know, maybe this isn&rsquo;t such a big deal. Y&rsquo;know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job <b>and</b> you get to have sex. Y&rsquo;know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you&rsquo;ve got Christmas.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I just&hellip; I just don&rsquo;t think that I want it that way though, y&rsquo;know? I mean, let&rsquo;s say I do make it, alright? I&rsquo;m always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y&rsquo;know, the Little General.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Didn&rsquo;t you used to call it the Little Major?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A restaurant. Fun Bobby and Monica are ordering.</h3>
<p>WAITER: Can I get you something from the bar?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes, I would like something. [looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind] No, no thank you.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> If&hellip; if you want to drink, it&rsquo;s OK with me, I&rsquo;ve got to get used to it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, no really. I.. I wouldn&rsquo;t feel right about it. [to waiter] Just some water.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> So the light went out in my refrigerator&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> [grabs waiter as he&rsquo;s leaving] I&rsquo;d like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.</p>

<p>[They look over at Russ and Ross.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> [to Russ] For your information, it&rsquo;s a card sharp, not a card shark.</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> You could not be more wrong. You could try&hellip; but you would not be successful.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK, I&rsquo;m gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> I know what your problem is.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh you do, do you?</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> Um-hum, you&rsquo;re jealous.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Of&hellip; of what?</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> You&rsquo;re jealous because I&rsquo;m a real doctor.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, you&rsquo;re a doctor of <b>gums</b>. That&rsquo;s the smallest body part you can major in. It&rsquo;s like day one, floss. Day two, here&rsquo;s your diploma.</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> Hey, you listen.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, let me finish.</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> No, let me finish.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Where ya goin&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ooooohhhh.</p>
<p>[Monica pulls out a bag full of airline bottles of liquor.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What&rsquo;s with all the bottles of liquor?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What&rsquo;s going on, is&hellip; uh, Bobby drinking again?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he&rsquo;s still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.</p>
<p>[Three slow knocks on the door.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, even his knock is boring.</p>
<p>[Monica answers the door. Its Fun Bobby.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi. I&rsquo;ll be ready in just a second.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Uh, can I talk to you a minute?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Sure.</p>
<p>[They both step out into the hall.]</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> This is really hard for me to say.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God, you fell off the wagon.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Oh, no, no, it&rsquo;s about you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What about me?</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> I think you may have a drinking problem.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh&hellip; shoot.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> OK.</p>
<p>[They hug and kiss.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Take care.</p>
<p><b>Fun Bobby:</b> You too.</p>
<p>[Fun Bobby leaves and Monica goes back inside.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What happened?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well we&hellip; we kinda broke up.</p>
<p><b>Gang:</b> Awwwwwwww.</p>
<p>[Ross, Phoebe, Chandler, and Rachel all exchange money.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> [holding bottles] Does anybody want these?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;ll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I&rsquo;m a giant.</p>
<p>[Joey enters.]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Gang:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> How&rsquo;d the callback go?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So what&rsquo;d you do?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I couldn&rsquo;t do it. I told her I didn&rsquo;t want to get the part that way.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Good for you.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So&hellip; and?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Soooooo&hellip; you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!</p>
<p><b>Gang:</b> Allright!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got to go shower. [leaves]</p>
<p>[Phoebe, Ross, Rachel, Chandler exchange money again.]</p>
<p><b>Credits</b> [Scene: <i>Central Perk</i>. Russ enters. Chandler and Phoebe are sitting on the couch.]</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;m sorry man.</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she&rsquo;s talking about?</p>
<p>[Chandler and Phoebe feign ignorance.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh I do, it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s Bob Saget. She hates him.</p>
<p><b>Russ:</b> Oh.</p>
<p>[Julie&hellip; Ross&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend&hellip; enters.]</p>
<p><b>Julie:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Julie:</b> Um, oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, it&rsquo;s definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I&rsquo;m doing OK. Actually I&rsquo;ve got some of his stuff that he, um&hellip;</p>
<p>[Russ and Julie look at each other with love in their eyes. The music builds&hellip;]</p>
