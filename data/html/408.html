<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is sitting at the counter reading a magazine as the phone rings.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (answering phone) Hello.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone) Hey, it&rsquo;s me. I know you can&rsquo;t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I&rsquo;d try and apologize over the phone. All I&hellip; (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)</p>
<p>(Pause)</p>
<p>(The phone rings again.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (answering phone) Hello.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I&rsquo;m&hellip; (Joey hangs up the phone again.)</p>
<p>(Pause)</p>
<p>(The phone rings yet again.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (answering phone) Stop callin&rsquo;!!</p>
<p><b>Voice:</b> (on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right!</p>
<p><b>Voice:</b> What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything&hellip; (Joey realizes it&rsquo;s Chandler and hangs up the phone in anger.)</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, everyone but Joey and Chandler are there getting ready for Thanksgiving.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look everyone, it&rsquo;s the spirit of Thanksgiving!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So are things with you and Joey any better?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> They couldn&rsquo;t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Should we <b>all</b> expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there&rsquo;s the added mystery of who gets who.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don&rsquo;t know why I do that.</p>
<p>[Cut to later, the gang, minus Joey, is watching the Thanksgiving Day parade.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We haven&rsquo;t eaten yet!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, but all that work you&rsquo;re doing to get it ready, I just&hellip; (goes into her bedroom.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, &lsquo;cause I wanna trade for her.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it&rsquo;s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let&rsquo;s trade!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh that&rsquo;s not true! That&rsquo;s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it&hellip; (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe&rsquo;s faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it&hellip; (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Op, y&rsquo;know what though, it&rsquo;s kind&rsquo;ve a girlie briefcase.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Who cares? He works in a museum!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You don&rsquo;t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren&rsquo;t here, you can watch the parade if you want.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God, what happened?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Open it up, let me see.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, y&rsquo;know what, I can&rsquo;t, it really kills.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well maybe you should put some ice on it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, God it looks bad.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can&rsquo;t go to him when I don&rsquo;t have a boyfriend!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> He&rsquo;s really picky about his patients.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Honey, you&rsquo;ve got to go. What&rsquo;s his office number?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I&rsquo;m calling on behalf of Monica Geller&rsquo;s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He&rsquo;s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes!!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes! She&rsquo;s very excited about that.</p>
<p>[Cut to later, Phoebe is adding butter to something and Ross is watching.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is so cool, &lsquo;til Monica gets back, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, get out of my kitchen!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right I&hellip; I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I&rsquo;m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh y&rsquo;know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?! Wow! That&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s so nice, what are you gonna get me?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no-no, you don&rsquo;t want to do that, then you&rsquo;re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, that&rsquo;s not true! I&rsquo;ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Like?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> When was the last time you saw her wear it?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Big dog?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is repacking the furniture into boxes to return it.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Everything? Even the TV?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No! I&rsquo;m putting that in my room.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don&rsquo;t you think you could at least hear the guy out?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Five years.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;ve sentenced him?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! Don&rsquo;t do the crime if you can&rsquo;t do the time.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey, the guy&rsquo;s your best friend.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, <b>was</b> my best friend. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there&rsquo;s a spot open.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, who? Me?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! I&rsquo;m honored! And y&rsquo;know what I&rsquo;m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. But if you weren&rsquo;t my best friend.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler and Kathy are sitting at a table and talking about Joey.</h3>
<p>KATHY: Oh my God, is it really that bad?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I walk into a room and he won&rsquo;t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I <b>know</b> he only knows the bad words.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?</p>
<p>GUNTHER: I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.</p>
<p>(Joey turns around and sees them kissing.)</p>
<p>KATHY: Oh.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey Joe.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Dr. Burke&rsquo;s office, Rachel and Monica are waiting as the doctor arrives.</h3>
<p><b>Doctor:</b> I&rsquo;ll be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, so cute, that I&rsquo;m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.</p>
<p>(The intercom buzzes.)</p>
<p><b>Nurse:</b> Dr. Burke will see you know.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.</p>
<p><b>Nurse:</b> Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Timothy Burke:</b> Ready?</p>
<p>(Monica looks at Rachel, who gives her the thumbs up.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is packing as Chandler rushes in.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! I&rsquo;m sorry! That&mdash;(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> My folks.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, y&rsquo;know at first I thought we could talk about this y&rsquo;know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don&rsquo;t think I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I&rsquo;ll stop seeing her?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, it&rsquo;s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don&rsquo;t want to live with some one who doesn&rsquo;t know what it is to be a friend. So, I&rsquo;ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! You did! And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m leaving.</p>
<p>(The chick and the duck walk into the living room.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right look, if you&rsquo;re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a <b>very</b> difficult year! What with the robbery and all!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! But if would&rsquo;ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn&rsquo;t have worried about it so much! See you around!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We&rsquo;ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Dr. Burke&rsquo;s office, Tim is examining Monica.</h3>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside <em>The Dairy Queen</em>.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I was probably waiting for it to open.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> I gotta tell you, you look great now.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You look great too.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> You&rsquo;re an excellent patient!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So how does it look?</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Well, you&rsquo;ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Like a pirate?!</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> If that helps you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> I moved back here a couple of months ago.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. Big family dinner tonight?</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No way!</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (disappointed) Oh.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> But we broke up.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (happy) Oh.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> She-she wasn&rsquo;t ready for a serious commitment.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate&rsquo;s voice) So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> You&rsquo;re not wearing the patch yet.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, It&rsquo;s closer to dinner. Monica has just told everyone that Tim is coming to dinner.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He&rsquo;s coming here for Thanksgiving!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, it&rsquo;s sick.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why is it sick?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because it&rsquo;s Richard&rsquo;s son! It&rsquo;s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I can see where I&rsquo;d be your best shot but, no. I&rsquo;m sorry, but I think it&rsquo;s twisted.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (coming out of the bathroom) What&rsquo;s twisted?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Me going out with Richard&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Is he okay in there?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> He&rsquo;s fine!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, y&rsquo;know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard&rsquo;s son, you&rsquo;d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian, (points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl&rsquo;s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler) livin&rsquo; in a box!! (goes to her room)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So now, what exactly is the point of the box?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (worried) Why?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I just wanna check something.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well isn&rsquo;t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What did you get?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Credit.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s a knock on the door.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (running in from her bedroom) I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! I&rsquo;ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Hi, nice to meet you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And Joey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Hi, Joey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> My brother, Ross.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that&rsquo;s Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> How do ya do.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> What&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, well, he&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> He&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; some thinkin&rsquo;!</p>
<p>[cut to later, Joey, Rachel, Ross, and Tim are watching the football game, and they all cheer loudly.]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What happened? What happened?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You kissed my girlfriend!</p>
<p>(A commercial for sunglasses comes on.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, I like those sunglasses.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Like &lsquo;em, like &lsquo;em? Or, I&rsquo;d like to get store credit for that amount like &lsquo;em?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Swears in Italian, it&rsquo;s the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right everybody, this turkey is ready!</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Where can I wash up?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Fancy soap? I thought we were savin&rsquo; that for the Pope!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> See he&rsquo;s nice. Right?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how your dad used to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s a loud knocking.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;ll get it. (goes over to the door.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Gotcha! (laughs)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That doesn&rsquo;t sound like thinking to me!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sorry!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&rsquo;know I don&rsquo;t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you&rsquo;ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay, you got it!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, can you pass me the yams?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure! Oh, and Joey&rsquo;s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh-ho-ho, we&rsquo;ve got company.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with me. See, I&rsquo;m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)</p>
<p>(an awkward silence follows)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can&rsquo;t tell, but I&rsquo;m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you&rsquo;re just an idiot in a box!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re right, and I&rsquo;m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won&rsquo;t say another word tonight.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Absolutely!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (There&rsquo;s no response from Chandler.) Okay.</p>
<p>(Rachel comes back carrying a shoe box.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Don&rsquo;t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what&rsquo;s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we&hellip; were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t know what to say, I&rsquo;m sorry. Though, you&rsquo;re not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It&rsquo;s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.</p>
<p>(Rachel glares at him.)</p>
<p>[Cut to the balcony with Monica and Tim.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Here, let me help. (Does so.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> You-you have a very beautiful&hellip; eye.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know all my friends think this is weird.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Y&rsquo;know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know! I mean it&rsquo;s like me and your dad, that&rsquo;s a totally separate thing.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Oh, I totally agree.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We&rsquo;re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?</p>
<p>(Tim leans in to kiss her. They stop, and when he tries to kiss her again, Monica pulls away.)</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing. Nothing.</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> No-no really, was-was that not okay?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Oh my God! It didn&rsquo;t remind you of&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting) Don&rsquo;t say it!</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> No, but it did! Didn&rsquo;t it?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Tim:</b> Oh man!!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know!</p>
<p>(They both shiver in horror.)</p>
<p>[cut to later, Tim has left. Monica is still shivering. There&rsquo;s a knock on the door.]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;ll get it. (It&rsquo;s Kathy.)</p>
<p>KATHY: (sees it&rsquo;s Joey) Oh.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>
<p>KATHY: Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s okay. Chandler&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;m mad at.</p>
<p>KATHY: Well, I&rsquo;m still sorry. Is he here?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> In the box.</p>
<p>KATHY: (going over to the box) Chandler?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, he-he can&rsquo;t talk right now.</p>
<p>KATHY: Why not? What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He&rsquo;s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.</p>
<p>KATHY: By being in a box?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, had reasons.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> They were threefold.</p>
<p>KATHY: Oh. Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm&hellip; (She looks at the gang who are watching, they take the hint and leave them alone.) Listen I don&rsquo;t wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can&rsquo;t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don&rsquo;t wanna be the cause of that. So, I don&rsquo;t think we can see each other anymore. I&rsquo;m gonna go to my mom&rsquo;s in Chicago, I&rsquo;m gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could&rsquo;ve be something really amazing, but y&rsquo;know this is probably for the best. Y&rsquo;know? I&rsquo;m gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.</p>
<p>(She gets up and leaves, Chandler waves good-bye with one finger extended through the air hole. Ross glares at Joey.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna be fine! Get out!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you did some real good thinkin&rsquo; in there.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Man, this is&hellip;</p>
<p>(Joey says something unintelligible and they hug.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Now go! &lsquo;Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you&rsquo;re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)</p>
<p>(After he&rsquo;s gone.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, who got Chandler? &lsquo;Cause I uh, need to trade.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, she sees him! Oh, they&rsquo;re hugging!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He&rsquo;s taking her purse!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, that&rsquo;s not them. I&rsquo;m gonna go call the police.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, there they are!</p>
<p>(They watch them making up and sigh)</p>
