<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Gunther is pouring Rachel coffee.</h3>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Here you go.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> (In his head) <i>Say Rachel, I was wondering if you&rsquo;d like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you&rsquo;d just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.</i></p>
<p><b>Mark:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! All right, let&rsquo;s go shoppin&rsquo;!!</p>
<p><b>Mark:</b> Um, y&rsquo;know, before we go ah, there&rsquo;s something I need to say.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, okay.</p>
<p><b>Mark:</b> I&rsquo;ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But since you were with Ross, I-I didn&rsquo;t do anything about it. But, now that you&rsquo;re not, I&rsquo;d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing, now.</p>
<p>(Gunther gets this hurt expression on his face and goes into the back room)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! Umm&hellip;</p>
<p>(She&rsquo;s interrupted by a loud crash and the sound of braking dishes. Followed quickly by another crash. Everyone turns and looks at the back room, as Gunther emerges.)</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> I dropped a cup.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The hallway between the two apartments, Pete and Monica are returning from their date.</h3>
<p><b>Pete:</b> &hellip;so y&rsquo;know, that&rsquo;s why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y&rsquo;know, so you could be like-like, &lsquo;Wash my car.&rsquo; &lsquo;Clean my room.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it&rsquo;ll understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, this is so great.</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> Yeah, it was.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.</p>
<p>(She goes into her apartment and sees Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross sitting there.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello, people who do not live here.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hi! Hello!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I gave you a key for emergencies!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We were out of <i>Doritos</i>.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, how&rsquo;d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> He&rsquo;s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He&rsquo;s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I&rsquo;m not attracted to him at all!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Still?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Noo!! It&rsquo;s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he&rsquo;s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from <i>Sharper Image</i>?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Two.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table and exits)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.</p>
<p><b>Monica and Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Theatre, Joey is arriving to rehearse the play he&rsquo;s in.</h3>
<p><b>The Director:</b> Joe. How&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast member.) Hey.</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, so you&rsquo;re playing Adrienne, huh?</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I&rsquo;m Joey Tribianni.</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.</p>
<p>(She goes over to the snack table, and Joey quickly runs over and pours her a cup of coffee.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So the ah, play&rsquo;s pretty great, huh?</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray&rsquo;s work. She&rsquo;s so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, forget about it. She rocks!</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Where do I know you from?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Dr. Drake Remoray. <i>Days of Our Lives</i>. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> No, that&rsquo;s not it. So, you&rsquo;re a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I&rsquo;ve done plays before. I&rsquo;m a serious actor.</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You&rsquo;re-you&rsquo;re-you&rsquo;re the guy that doesn&rsquo;t know how to pour milk!!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> See, I actually <b>can</b> pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn&rsquo;t. Now, see, that&rsquo;s acting.</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, that was real.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe about Mark, as Gunther eavesdrops behind them.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What, so what are you gonna tell him?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I told him I would think about it, but I&rsquo;m gonna tell him no.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Huh.</p>
<p>(Gunther tries to swoop in to ask Rachel out.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean I think I&rsquo;d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I&rsquo;m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who&rsquo;s asking me to go out with him, which I&rsquo;m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y&rsquo;know, like I&rsquo;d be cheating on Ross or something.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you&rsquo;re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t have any issues with my Father.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, so it&rsquo;s probably just the Ross thing then.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is telling Chandler about Kate.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can&rsquo;t do it, they&rsquo;re all like-like laughing at me.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hello.</p>
<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow, what-what do you think she wants?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me&hellip; a-sucks.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s possible. You are very loveable, I&rsquo;d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Then be supportive like a guy.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I&rsquo;d miss you.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is there as Ross enters, walking very confidently.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You ah, wanted to see me?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Ahh, here&rsquo;s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD&rsquo;s, just sort of stuff that you&rsquo;ve left here.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Ross, it, it just seems that y&rsquo;know it&rsquo;s time we-we y&rsquo;know, move on. I mean, I mean don&rsquo;t&rsquo; you think?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, I do.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this was a gift?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s still a gift! I got it from the <b>gift shop</b>!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, all right, give me the mug! I&rsquo;ll keep the mug.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No!! Y&rsquo;know-y&rsquo;know don&rsquo;t do me any favours. In fact, where, where&rsquo;s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I&rsquo;d like that back too. Yes, I do.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m just trying to help you, move on.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Petty&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Petty&hellip; (goes into her room)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Petty&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Petty&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Petty&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Small&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Small&hellip; (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking her.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You are so just doing this out of spite.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn&rsquo;t even fit you anymore!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. It&rsquo;s an old &lsquo;Frankie says relax&rsquo; T-shirt, that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don&rsquo;t mind I&rsquo;m gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, the gang minus Rachel and Ross are talking to Pete.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, you&rsquo;re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And you&rsquo;re our age. You&rsquo;re our age.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> What like Pete Dakota?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s not a state Joe.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> I got to go, so ah, I&rsquo;ll see you guys later.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re our age!</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> (to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says&hellip;) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I&rsquo;m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there&rsquo;s no future? Either they&rsquo;re too old, or they&rsquo;re too young, and then there&rsquo;s Pete who&rsquo;s-who&rsquo;s crazy about me, and who&rsquo;s absolutely perfect for me, and there&rsquo;s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something&rsquo;s wrong with me?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, kinda.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing for the play.</h3>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Happy?! Is that what I&rsquo;m supposed to be Vic? Happy?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, why don&rsquo;t you tell me what you&rsquo;re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can&rsquo;t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin&rsquo;. You look at me, and it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;. (He kisses her) Nothing.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> Tasty! I&rsquo;m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> I have a question about this scene.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> Yes?</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Well, I don&rsquo;t understand why Adrienne&rsquo;s attracted to Victor.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> Peel the onion. First of all, he&rsquo;s good looking.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> I think my character&rsquo;s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it&rsquo;s says so in the script! Y&rsquo;know ah, I-I don&rsquo;t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you&rsquo;re a bitch.</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> It doesn&rsquo;t say that in the script.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It does in mine!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Hallway, Chandler and Ross are returning from working out.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It&rsquo;s so annoying. Does it bug you?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You bug me.</p>
<p>[Rachel comes out of her apartment, followed by Mark, and they leave on their date, without saying a word to Ross. Ross is stunned.]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is there any chance you didn&rsquo;t see that?</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is watching a basketball game, Ross is staring out the peephole.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can&rsquo;t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You&rsquo;re gonna get peep eye!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y&rsquo;know, she&rsquo;d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You didn&rsquo;t just break up.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, it&rsquo;s been like three weeks!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I&rsquo;m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she&rsquo;s going in.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She&rsquo;s going in. Wait! He&rsquo;s going in! He&rsquo;s going in!! The door&rsquo;s closed! I, I can&rsquo;t see anything but the door closed!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Stop what?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I&rsquo;ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!</p>
<p>(He starts to exit, but Chandler tries to stop him by climbing on his back and grabbing hold of the foosball table.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No!! You can&rsquo;t!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, they must be stopped!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I need juice! People need juice!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look man!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> People need juice!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Juice, I need&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> She&rsquo;s moving on! Okay, if it&rsquo;s not this guy, it&rsquo;s gonna be somebody else! And unless you&rsquo;re thinking about subletting my peep hole, <b>you</b> are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s just I miss her so much.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know. (He rubs Ross&rsquo;s head)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is pouring Mark some coffee.</h3>
<p><b>Mark:</b> Why do all you&rsquo;re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. That&rsquo;s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s number 27?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>(She sits down, and Mark leans over and kisses her. Rachel doesn&rsquo;t react. He tries it again, and Rachel jumps back quickly.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&rsquo;know what?</p>
<p><b>Mark:</b> No. And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m gonna want to.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p><b>Mark:</b> Yep. Yep, that&rsquo;s what I didn&rsquo;t want to know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, oh, Mark, I&rsquo;m doing this for the wrong reasons, y&rsquo;know? I&rsquo;m just doing it to get back at Ross. I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s not very fair to you.</p>
<p><b>Mark:</b> Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y&rsquo;know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God. I&rsquo;m sorry about this.</p>
<p><b>Mark:</b> That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You sure?</p>
<p><b>Mark:</b> Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Hospital Reception, Monica and Pete are there.</h3>
<p><b>Spokeswoman:</b> &hellip;has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> (to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> Where are we?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I&rsquo;m gonna say, midget rodeo.</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> Just tell me the truth.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Umm, y&rsquo;know, I don&rsquo;t think, I don&rsquo;t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> Oh, yeah. Wasn&rsquo;t that like a year ago?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So I did tell you. Okay, y&rsquo;know, that really isn&rsquo;t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I&rsquo;m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y&rsquo;know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> Oh, yeah. I know that.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I so wanna be attracted to you.</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> But you&rsquo;re not. Okay, good.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> Y&rsquo;know what, don&rsquo;t be. This is not, don&rsquo;t be, &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s not so bad.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s not?</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> I know I&rsquo;m no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone who find attractive, I&rsquo;m just, I think, y&rsquo;know, that you might end up feeling differently.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, um, look I-I don&rsquo;t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn&rsquo;t attracted too.</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> Yeah, stupidly charming isn&rsquo;t&rsquo; it? Well listen let&rsquo;s, you wanna get something to eat? &lsquo;Cause this place is kinda <b>de</b>pressing. (they start to leave)</p>
<p><b>Spokeswoman:</b> And the man who made all this possible&hellip; Mr. Peter Becker.</p>
<p><b>Pete:</b> (to Monica) One second.</p>
<p>(He takes the scissors, cuts the ribbon, shakes her hand, posses for the picture, and leaves.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is sitting in one of the black chairs, and turns to face the other one.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)</p>
<p>(Joey enters.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she&rsquo;s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so talented.&rsquo; and &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so pretty,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ooh, I smell so good.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think somebody has a crush on somebody.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y&rsquo;know?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m talking about you. You big, big freak.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you&rsquo;re out of your mind.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you&rsquo;d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Theatre, Kate and Joey are rehearsing the same scene as before.</h3>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Happy?! Is that what I&rsquo;m supposed to be Vic? Happy?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, why don&rsquo;t you tell me what you&rsquo;re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can&rsquo;t figure it out! I talk to you and it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;. You look at me, and nothin&rsquo;. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we&rsquo;re gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Well, that was ah&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Better?</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G&rsquo;night.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah, Kate?</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You ah, you forgot your shoes.</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> (she giggles) I&rsquo;m probably gonna need those. Huh? (she giggles some more)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, listen you ah&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Hmm?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &hellip;feel like getting a cup of coffee?</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Umm.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> (leaning in) Kate?</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Yep.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> You ready to go?</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> (to Joey) Very nice. Very nice. (he walks away)</p>
<p><b>Kate:</b> So umm, I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow, huh?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica is in the kitchen chopping vegetables. Chandler and Phoebe are sitting in the living room.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn&rsquo;t it Spiderman? Y&rsquo;know like Goldman, Silverman&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &lsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s not his last name.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It isn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it&rsquo;s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He&rsquo;s a spider, man. Y&rsquo;know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there&rsquo;s no Gold Man.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Rach, how was work?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn&rsquo;t a chair.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I&rsquo;m just gonna throw it out, it&rsquo;s probably just a bunch of shampoo and&hellip; (she opens the box and stops)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Something wrong?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)</p>
