<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s not the end.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yu-huh. That&rsquo;s when my mother would shut off the TV and say &lsquo;The end&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What about the part where he has rabies?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He doesn&rsquo;t have rabies, he has babies. That&rsquo;s what my mom said.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Uh, Phoebe, I don&rsquo;t think your mom would want you to see what&rsquo;s about to happen.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What, what&rsquo;s about to happen? [starts watching] I&rsquo;ve never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin&rsquo; with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun.

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we&rsquo;ve got leftovers&hellip; Chicken and potatoes&hellip; What am I wearing?&hellip;Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.</p>
<p>[Chandler and Joey come sprinting in]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ya know, one of these times you&rsquo;re gonna really be naked and we&rsquo;re not gonna come over.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, I&rsquo;ve got a leg, three breasts and a wing.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, how do you find clothes that fit?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, hey, Monica, we&rsquo;ve got a question.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don&rsquo;t look.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, not that one. We&rsquo;re trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, Ross can&rsquo;t go so it&rsquo;s between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. [starts poking Monica in the shoulder] &rsquo;did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok. [Richard walks in] Hey, why don&rsquo;t you ask Richard?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who&rsquo;s a huge Knicks fan.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, that&rsquo;s Eric.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Glad to be of help. Matches. [walks out to the balcony]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I meant, why don&rsquo;t you take Richard to the game? What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> C&rsquo;mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he&rsquo;s always minty fresh.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, Richard&rsquo;s really nice and everything, uh, it&rsquo;s just that we don&rsquo;t know him really well, ya know, and plus he&rsquo;s, ya know, old [Monica gives him a glare] -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So what, he&rsquo;s a little older, big deal, I mean he&rsquo;s important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. [walks off]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> How do we say yes now and make it seem like we&rsquo;re not doin&rsquo; it just to ride in the cool car?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, this could be tough.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> [Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we&rsquo;ll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, you almost had it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know what, I think it&rsquo;s cute, you trying to be more like Richard.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look it&rsquo;s the artist formerly known as Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Just tryin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; here, ya know.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So Joey, why didn&rsquo;t you grow a moustache?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we&rsquo;d look like dorks.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey listen, we&rsquo;ve gotta go, I promised Richard we&rsquo;d meet him downstairs.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You&rsquo;re meeting Richard?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to a Ranger game.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, didn&rsquo;t he tell ya?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn&rsquo;t know that you were the guys.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You hear that? We&rsquo;re the guys.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We&rsquo;re the guys.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> With that moustache doesn&rsquo;t Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk. Rachel is working. Ross enters with Ben.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi, we&rsquo;re visitiing. It&rsquo;s Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I&rsquo;m gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No luck huh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but&hellip; Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, &rsquo;cause I, I gotta take this off.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, yeah sure, Ok. [she takes Ben and holds him at arms length]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What&rsquo;re you doing?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, I&rsquo;m holding Ben.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well, he&rsquo;s a baby not a bomb.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well just hold him like you&rsquo;d hold a football.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> This is how I would hold a football.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, here, here. There we go.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m just not very good with babies. I mean I haven&rsquo;t been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s alright, it&rsquo;s no big deal.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, definitely, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll feel totally different when it&rsquo;s our baby.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You think about stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we&rsquo;ll have, we&rsquo;ll have two babies.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Two, two babies?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won&rsquo;t feel too competitive.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Then what&rsquo;s gonna happen?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, we won&rsquo;t wanna raise kids in the city so we&rsquo;ll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we&rsquo;ll be far enough away from our parents that we don&rsquo;t have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let&rsquo;s say, Nassau county but the school system&rsquo;s supposedly great.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow. Wow, that&rsquo;s great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don&rsquo;t have a pot. I don&rsquo;t have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I&rsquo;ve got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? [leaves]</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Monica and Richard are there. Phoebe enters.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Hey Phoebs, what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So you watched the movies huh?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, &rsquo;cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Charlotte who?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It&rsquo;s like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, you wanna feel better?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, here, watch this.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <i>It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life</i>. Yes I&rsquo;ve heard of this.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So you can&rsquo;t lose, it&rsquo;s there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, <i>Pride of the Yankees</i>, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn&rsquo;t you kinda see it coming?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> [runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Hey, be right there.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> There&rsquo;s a game?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> It&rsquo;s the basketball playoffs.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don&rsquo;t have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Oh, no, honey, I mean, don&rsquo;t worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It&rsquo;s fun for me. They&rsquo;re different than my other friends, they don&rsquo;t start sentences with, &lsquo;You know who just died shoveling snow?&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright that&rsquo;s great, then just go. Go Knicks.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Uh, it&rsquo;s the college playoffs.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, then go Vassar.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Uh, they&rsquo;re not in it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, then just go.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Ok. [leaves]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don&rsquo;t wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s just that he doesn&rsquo;t have that much free time, ya know, and I don&rsquo;t know, what do I do?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does it matter? You&rsquo;re ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> [enters] Aghh.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Me too. [leaves]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;ve got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ya know what, I think I&rsquo;m gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there&rsquo;s something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> [enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, you tell me. One minute I&rsquo;m holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I&rsquo;ve got two kids, I&rsquo;m living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I&rsquo;m sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you&rsquo;re at work, you&rsquo;re assembling bones, your mind wanders.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we&rsquo;ve been dating for six weeks.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> C&rsquo;mon, what, you never think about our future?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, but I, I think about who&rsquo;s apartment we&rsquo;re gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we&rsquo;re gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens&rsquo; names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What was the book?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> The big book of childrens&rsquo; names.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It&rsquo;s what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I&rsquo;m sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok fine.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> We&rsquo;re not done.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, then you&rsquo;re gonna have to understand that you&rsquo;re with a guy who&rsquo;s not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we&rsquo;re gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re gonna have to deal with that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Fine, I will.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Good, &rsquo;cause I love you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well I love you too.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well that&rsquo;s the first time we&rsquo;ve said that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes it is.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m gonna kiss you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well you better.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Monica is in the kitchen, Phoebe enters.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Did you like it?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah. You know, I don&rsquo;t know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, I&rsquo;ll give you the ear thing but don&rsquo;t you think the ending was pretty wonderful?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I didn&rsquo;t watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sucky life and just when you think it can&rsquo;t suck any more it does.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s apartment. Chandler and Joey are playing Richard at foosball.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Kick save and&hellip; denied.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> But&hellip; he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and&hellip; BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Man you are incredible.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Well, we had a table in college.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh really, I didn&rsquo;t know they had foosball in the 1800&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing&rsquo;s really gonna kick in.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> [enters] Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner&rsquo;s on the table.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Ok, just one more point.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> [grabs the other two bars on Richard&rsquo;s side and scores] Score! Now can we go?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> See, that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t let her play.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Is everything all right?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Um-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Uh-oh.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh hey listen, don&rsquo;t be mad at him, it&rsquo;s our fault. I&rsquo;m sorry we&rsquo;ve been hoggin so much of his time.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, he&rsquo;s just really great to hang around with.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Well.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. [Chandler starts kicking him below the table] I mean, you know, our dad&rsquo;s are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I&rsquo;m tryin to talk here.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Uh, you guys see me as a dad?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooooo.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Uh-huh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No no, seriously, Joey&rsquo;s my dad, Monica&rsquo;s my dad. I&rsquo;ve even got some dads down at work.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> That&rsquo;s fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I&rsquo;ll just see you kids around.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nighty-nite.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re not a dad. You&rsquo;re not a dad.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Not a dad.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you got us into trouble. [slaps Joey on the arm. Joey takes exception and slaps him back]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> [her and Richard return to her place] So are you ok?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Yeah, just, I feel like I&rsquo;m about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Come here. I&rsquo;ll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> What&rsquo;re you talkin&rsquo; about, I was killin&rsquo; &rsquo;em.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, well they suck too.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross&rsquo;s apartment. Rachel is changing Ben&rsquo;s diaper under Ross&rsquo;s supervision.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn&rsquo;t make this process any cuter.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> [doorbell buzzes] Hello.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> It&rsquo;s us.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on up. I&rsquo;m gonna get the rest of his stuff together. [walks in his room]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wha, what?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ben just said hi.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What, the word hi?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.</p>

<h2>Closing Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Phoebe is watching Bert and Ernie with Ben.</h3>
<p><i><b>Ernie:</b> Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I&rsquo;ve been digging. Hey Bert, isn&rsquo;t this a nice hole here. Hey.</i></p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> [pauses the tape] Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can&rsquo;t find him. Now, I&rsquo;ve looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there&rsquo;s some pretty rough goin&rsquo; for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there&rsquo;s just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. [starts the tape again]</p>
<p><i><b>Ernie:</b> Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.</i></p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here.</p>
