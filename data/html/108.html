<p class="scene">[Scene: Chandler&rsquo;s Office, Chandler is on a coffee break. Shelley enters.)<b><br>
<br> Shelley:</b> Hey gorgeous, how&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights&hellip; does it <b>get</b> better than this?</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> Question. You&rsquo;re not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, y&rsquo;see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said &lsquo;co-dependent&rsquo;, or &rsquo;self-destructive&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> Do you want a date Saturday?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes please.</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> Okay. He&rsquo;s cute, he&rsquo;s funny, he&rsquo;s-</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> He&rsquo;s a he?</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> Well yeah! &hellip;Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I&rsquo;m just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now&hellip;(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye&hellip;</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, everyone is there.)</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;Couldn&rsquo;t enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um&hellip; yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y&rsquo;know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You did?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe&rsquo;s entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Huh. Did, uh&hellip; any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I did.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I think so, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Not me.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y&rsquo;know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re kidding! Did you tell her I wasn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No. No, it&rsquo;s just &rsquo;cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman&hellip; who also liked her, so&hellip;</p>
<p>(Joey congratulates Ross, sees Chandler&rsquo;s look and abruptly stops.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I dunno, &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re smart, you&rsquo;re funny&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ross is smart and funny, d&rsquo;you ever think that about him?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! Right!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> WHAT IS IT?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I-I d&rsquo;know, you-you just- you have a quality.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Yes. Absolutely. A quality.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.</p>
<p>(Phone rings; Monica gets it)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it&rsquo;s Paolo calling from Rome.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) <i>Bon giorno, caro mio.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Joey) So he&rsquo;s calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I&rsquo;m talking to Rome.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey dad, what&rsquo;s up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it&rsquo;s Nana.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and Monica enter and everyone says hi and kisses.)</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So, uh, how&rsquo;s she doing?</p>
<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> The doctor says it&rsquo;s a matter of hours.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How-how are you, Mom?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Me? I&rsquo;m fine, fine. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here. &hellip;What&rsquo;s with your hair?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> What&rsquo;s different?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh, maybe that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>(Monica strides over to Ross, who is making coffee, and talks to him aside.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> She is unbelievable, our mother is&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh God!</p>
<p>(They hug.)</p>
<p>[Cut to the hospital, later. Everyone is talking about Nana.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! &hellip;Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet &lsquo;n&rsquo; Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Not just restaurants, from our house.</p>
<p>(The nurse comes out of Nana&rsquo;s room.)</p>
<p><b>Nurse:</b> Mrs. Geller?</p>
<p>(Everyone stands up. Cut to Ross and Monica in Nana&rsquo;s room.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She looks so small.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, at least she&rsquo;s with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> G&rsquo;bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Bye, Nana.</p>
<p>(He goes to kiss her but she moves. Monica screams. Ross shouts and stares in disbelief. Monica runs out of the room.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross!</p>
<p>(Ross runs out too.)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> What is going on?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&rsquo;know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she&rsquo;s not, quite..</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She&rsquo;s not- past, she&rsquo;s present, she&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> (reentering) What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> She may have died.</p>
<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> She <b>may</b> have died?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> We&rsquo;re looking into it.</p>
<p>(Monica returns with the nurse and they go into Nana&rsquo;s room.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I, uh, I&rsquo;ll go see. (He goes in)</p>
<p><b>Nurse:</b> This almost never happens!</p>
<p>(Nana passes for the second time and the nurse pulls the blanket over her. Ross and Monica go to tell the family)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> <b>Now</b> she&rsquo;s passed.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey, and Rachel are there.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that&rsquo;s exactly what it is. It&rsquo;s your hair.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, you have homosexual hair.</p>
<p>(Monica and Ross enter.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, um, did she&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Twice.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Twice?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, that sucks!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You guys okay?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I dunno, it&rsquo;s weird. I mean, I know she&rsquo;s gone, but I just don&rsquo;t feel, uh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe that&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause she&rsquo;s not really gone.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Nono, she&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We checked. A lot.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she&rsquo;s like right here, y&rsquo;know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y&rsquo;know? &hellip;I miss her.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Now, see, I don&rsquo;t believe any of that. I think once you&rsquo;re dead, you&rsquo;re dead! You&rsquo;re gone! You&rsquo;re worm food! (realises his tactlessness) &hellip;So Chandler looks gay, huh?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I dunno who this is, but it&rsquo;s not Debbie. (Hands back the pencil)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Nana&rsquo;s house, Ross, Mrs. Geller and Aunt Lillian are going through clothes.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Well, that doesn&rsquo;t mean she can&rsquo;t look nice!</p>
<p>(They open a cupboard which, amongst other things, contains a chest of drawers)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Sweetie, you think you can get in there?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (sarcastic) I don&rsquo;t see why not.</p>
<p>(He tries pushing against the chest of drawers. Then he opens one of the drawers and climbs into the closet using that; he falls behind the chest of drawers with a shout.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Here&rsquo;s my retainer!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica is talking to her father.</h3>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I was just thinking. When my time comes-</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Dad!</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You what?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Define fun.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> C&rsquo;mon, you&rsquo;ll make a day of it! You&rsquo;ll rent a boat, pack a lunch&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &hellip;And then we throw your body in the water&hellip; Gee, that does sound fun.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says &lsquo;Jack Geller, so predictable&rsquo;. Maybe after I&rsquo;m gone, they&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;Buried at sea! Huh!&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s probably what they&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I&rsquo;d like that.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s Office, Shelley is drinking coffee; Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, gorgeous.</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> (sheepish) Hey. Look, I&rsquo;m sorry about yesterday, I, um-</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, nono, don&rsquo;t- don&rsquo;t worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> Oh! Okay! Phew!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, uh&hellip; what do you think it is about me?</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> I dunno, uh&hellip; you just have a-a&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;Quality, right, great.</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> Y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s a shame, because you and Lowell would&rsquo;ve made a great couple.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Lowell? Financial Services&rsquo; Lowell, that&rsquo;s who you saw me with?</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> What? He&rsquo;s cute!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, yeah&hellip; &rsquo;s&rsquo;no Brian in Payroll.</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> Is Brian&hellip;?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! Uh, I d&rsquo;know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I&rsquo;d like to think you&rsquo;d set me up with someone like him.</p>
<p><b>Shelley:</b> Well, I think Brian&rsquo;s a little out of your league.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excuse me? You don&rsquo;t think I could get a Brian? Because I could <b>get</b> a Brian. Believe you me. &hellip;I&rsquo;m really not.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Nana&rsquo;s Bedroom, Ross is holding a dress out from inside the closet.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?</p>
<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.</p>
<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> You know, whatever we pick, she would&rsquo;ve told us it&rsquo;s the wrong one.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> You&rsquo;re right. We&rsquo;ll go with the burgundy.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! A fine choice. I&rsquo;m coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)</p>
<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> Wait! We need shoes!</p>
<p>(Ross falls back inside)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> That&rsquo;s really a day shoe.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And where she&rsquo;s going everyone else&rsquo;ll be dressier?</p>
<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> Could we see something in a slimmer heel?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.</p>
<p><b>Aunt Lillian:</b> No, it really should be burgundy.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.</p>
<p>(He finds a shoebox (out of shot), pulls it down and opens it. It is full of <em>Sweet &lsquo;n&rsquo; Lo</em>&rsquo;s.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God..</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Is everything all right, dear?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, just&hellip; just Nana stuff.</p>
<p>(He reaches up higher and knocks down another shoebox lid. <em>Sweet &lsquo;n&rsquo; Lo</em>&rsquo;s rain down on him)</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica and Rachel are preparing to leave for the funeral.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Some days it&rsquo;s all I can think about.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hi, sorry I&rsquo;m late, I couldn&rsquo;t find my bearings.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you-you mean your earrings?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What&rsquo;d I say?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Are these the shoes?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What, we-uh- we don&rsquo;t have shoes here, or&hellip;?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, don&rsquo;t we look nice all dressed up?&hellip;It&rsquo;s stuff like that, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>(They all leave.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The cemetary, after the funeral.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It was a really beautiful service.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> It really was. Oh, c&rsquo;mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y&rsquo;know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.</p>
<p>(Joey listens to his overcoat for a second and sighs, then notices Chandler watching)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re watching a football game at a funeral?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, it&rsquo;s the pre-game. I&rsquo;m gonna watch it at the reception.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You are a frightening, frightening man.</p>
<p>(Rachel steps in a patch of mud)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I hope they&rsquo;re not ruined.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> God, what a great day. &hellip;What? Weather-wise!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know, uh, the air, the-the trees&hellip; even though Nana&rsquo;s gone there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave)</p>
<p><b>All:</b> God! Ross!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m fine. Just-just&hellip; having my worst fear realised&hellip;</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Wake, at the Gellers&rsquo; house. Ross is lying on his back, with Phoebe squatting over him, checking to see if he&rsquo;s injured.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m just checking to see if the muscle&rsquo;s in spasm&hellip;huh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What, what is it?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You missed a belt loop.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! No-n-</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, it&rsquo;s in spasm.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. (Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)</p>
<p>(Cut to Chandler and a woman, Andrea, reaching for the same slice of meat)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no-</p>
<p><b>Andrea:</b> Sorry- Hi, I&rsquo;m Dorothy&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi, I&rsquo;m Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.</p>
<p>(They shake hands. Cut to Ross emerging from a hallway, grinning inanely. He is obviously very stoned)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, look who&rsquo;s up! How do you feel?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, those pills really worked, huh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! &hellip;I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs&hellip; (Hugs her)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! That&rsquo;s so nice&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &hellip;Chandler!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn&rsquo;t matter to me.</p>
<p><b>Andrea:</b> (turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.. you don&rsquo;t get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)</p>
<p>(Cut to Joey watching TV in the corner. He makes an extravagant gesture of disappointment.)</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Whaddya got there?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh&hellip; hearing disability.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> What&rsquo;s the score?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Seventeen-fourteen Giants&hellip; three minutes to go in the third.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)</p>
<p>(Time lapse. A large crowd of men are now watching the game)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> (to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> No, I&rsquo;d be hearing about &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I get the honey-glazed ham?&rsquo;, I didn&rsquo;t spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she&rsquo;d be saying &lsquo;Why are you wasting your money? I don&rsquo;t need flowers, I&rsquo;m dead&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That sounds like Nana.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Do you know what it&rsquo;s like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &hellip;I can imagine.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> I&rsquo;m telling you, it&rsquo;s a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Tell her what?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair&hellip; for example.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> I&rsquo;m not sure I know what you&rsquo;re getting at.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you think things would have been better if you&rsquo;d just told her the truth?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> &hellip;No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it&rsquo;s nicer when people just get along.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> More wine, dear?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I think so.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> (reaches out to fiddle with Monica&rsquo;s hair again, and realises) Those earrings look really lovely on you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. They&rsquo;re yours.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Actually they were Nana&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>(There is a cry of disappointment from the crowd of men.)</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Now I&rsquo;m depressed! &hellip;(To everyone) Even more than I was.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, the gang are looking at old photos.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, who&rsquo;s this little naked guy?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That little naked guy would be me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aww, look at the little thing.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Who are those people?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Got me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that&rsquo;s Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) &rsquo;me and the gang at Java Joe&rsquo;s&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Let&rsquo;s see, 1939&hellip; yeah, 24, 25?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I&rsquo;m, uh, just trying something.</p>

<h2>Closing Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s Office, Chandler is on a coffee break as Lowell enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Lowell.</p>
<p><b>Lowell:</b> Hey, Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So how&rsquo;s it going there in Financial Services?</p>
<p><b>Lowell:</b> It&rsquo;s like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How &lsquo;bout you?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh&hellip; I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p><b>Lowell:</b> I know. That&rsquo;s what I told her.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>Lowell:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So- you can tell?</p>
<p><b>Lowell:</b> Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of&hellip; radar.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you don&rsquo;t think I have a, a quality?</p>
<p><b>Lowell:</b> Speaking for my people, I&rsquo;d have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> He <b>is</b>?</p>
<p><b>Lowell:</b> Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.</p>
