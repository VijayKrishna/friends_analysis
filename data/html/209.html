<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And twenty-five it is.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You gave him cookies?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares&hellip; Alright, we&rsquo;re broke, but cookies do say that.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?</p>

<p>[There&rsquo;s a bang at the door.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.</p>
<p>[Joey opens the door and picks up the remnants of the newspaper.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhhh, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna like this.</p>
<p>[Joey shows them the torn-up newspaper.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, &lsquo;Gershwin musical&rsquo; actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nah, Phoebs, that&rsquo;s the guy that comes in the frame.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No it isn&rsquo;t, this is my dad, alright, I&rsquo;ll show you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, that&rsquo;s my stepdad. My real dad&rsquo;s the one that ran out on us before I was born.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> How have you never been on Oprah?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s not a blue screen&hellip; it&rsquo;s just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, wait a minute honey.</p>
<p><b>Gang:</b> Phoebs. [Phoebe leaves]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So anyway, I&rsquo;m trying to get my boss&rsquo;s ex-wife to sleep with me&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Gang:</b> Joey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone&rsquo;s all ears!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Phoebe&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s place. Phoebe&rsquo;s grandmother is sitting at the table, reading the obituaries, and crossing out names in the phonebook.</h3>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Esther Livingston. [scratches out name] Gone.</p>
<p>[Phoebe enters.]</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Hi, Phoe.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi Gram. Whatcha doin&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Oh, just updating the phonebook.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> [nervously] Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Just, you know, to see&hellip; um.</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Oh, sure, yeah. [gets a box with the pictures] This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation&hellip; another graduation&hellip; another graduation.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, is this really my father?</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Is it really your fa&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&hellip; well of course it is.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause someone&rsquo;s pants are on fire.</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Look, I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Alright, that is not your father, that&rsquo;s just a picture of a guy in a frame.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh God.</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> It was your mother&rsquo;s idea. Ya know, she didn&rsquo;t want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn&rsquo;t want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Alright, so, what, he&rsquo;s not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn&rsquo;t live in a hut in Burma where there&rsquo;s no phones?</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Honey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> [realizes] Oh.</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Anyway, that&rsquo;s all I know. That, and this. [pulls apart a frame and pulls a picture out] This is the real him.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Rachel, Chandler, and Joey are decorating the Christmas tree.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn&rsquo;t want anybody to see him but he&rsquo;d be drunk so he&rsquo;d stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a very merry Christmas.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Who said anything about Christmas?</p>
<p>[Monica and Ross enter.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, nothin&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I hope she&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I know exactly what she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; through.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How do you know exactly what she&rsquo;s going through?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> She told us.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So whaddya got there Monica?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Just some stuff for the party.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, what&rsquo;re you guys doin&rsquo; here, aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be Christmas shopping?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You guys haven&rsquo;t gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow&rsquo;s Christmas Eve, what&rsquo;re ya gonna do?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Don&rsquo;t you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, by the way Mon, I don&rsquo;t think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn&rsquo;t give him enough.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.</p>
<p>[Ross approaches Rachel, away from everyone else.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what&rsquo;ll make you feel better. How &lsquo;bout you make a list about me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wha&hellip; forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> C&rsquo;mon Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, you&rsquo;re whiney, you are, you&rsquo;re obsessive, you are insecure, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re gutless, you know, you don&rsquo;t ever, you don&rsquo;t just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn&rsquo;t do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, and you know what? You&rsquo;re right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. [she walks off and Ross puts his hand to his hair]</p>

<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> C&rsquo;mon now Phoe, don&rsquo;t still be mad at me. How&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, not so good. Upstate&rsquo;s pretty big, he&rsquo;s pretty small, you do the math.</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Well, I think you&rsquo;re better off without him. Oh honey, I know he&rsquo;s your daddy but, but to me he&rsquo;s still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> I know. OK, I wasn&rsquo;t completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn&rsquo;t know exactly where he lived.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Whattaya mean?</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you&rsquo;ve gone too far. You can take my cab.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Grandmother:</b> Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I&rsquo;m gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss to a picture of Einstein]</p>
