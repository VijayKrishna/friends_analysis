<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No. Y&rsquo;know how we&rsquo;re always saying we need a place for the mail.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re building a post office?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It&rsquo;s a one day job, max.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word! Those are snug.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>(Chandler goes to his bedroom and opens the door. However, only the top half opens, and he trips into his bedroom over the bottom half.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Power saw kinda got away from me there.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well relax, he&rsquo;ll be here.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I know, I&rsquo;m just nervous. Y&rsquo;know it&rsquo;s just y&rsquo;know Mom&rsquo;s dead, don&rsquo;t talk to my sister, Grandma&rsquo;s been sleeping a lot lately. It&rsquo;s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y&rsquo;know, kinda thing. You&rsquo;re so sweet to wait with me.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Monica, who would yours be?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s just a game Mon. (makes a &lsquo;Can-you-believe-her&rsquo; face to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, we don&rsquo;t really take advantage of living in the city.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I know.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is drilling a hole in the wall and the drill comes out the other side really close to Chandler&rsquo;s head. Chandler then rushes out to talk to Joey.</h3>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why, what&rsquo;s wrong with my bathroom floor?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Nothing. It&rsquo;s just old and dingy, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s a little more than I wanted to see.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It&rsquo;d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.</p>
<p>(Joey places the toliet brush and holder over the hole, which is in the middle of the floor.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So how&rsquo;s it going with you guys?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) Y&rsquo;know what it&rsquo;s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we <b>keep</b> the varnish.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, on three. One&hellip;Two&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Why don&rsquo;t we just go on two.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why two?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Because it&rsquo;s faster.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this &lsquo;two&rsquo; talk.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, but in the future&hellip;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Heavy thing, not getting lighter!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, one&hellip;two&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So we are going on two?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem, the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, good job Joe.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow, it&rsquo;s big!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe, my ruler&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe all the rulers are wrong.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look it&rsquo;s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, y&rsquo;know what I got a better idea. How-how &lsquo;bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it doesn&rsquo;t move.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel is serving some guy coffee.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.</p>
<p>(Isabella Rosselini enters)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Gunther) Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Isabella:</b> (to Gunther) Um, coffee to go, please.</p>
<p>(Ross recognises her and goes over to the couch, mouthing &lsquo;Oh my God&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Damn! I can&rsquo;t believe I took her off my list.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why? &lsquo;Cause otherwise you&rsquo;d go for it?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh, you lie.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d go up to her?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You know what honey, you go ahead, we&rsquo;ll call her an alternate.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, hold my crawler.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, he&rsquo;s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I&rsquo;m just sorry we don&rsquo;t got popcorn.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I&rsquo;m Ross, you don&rsquo;t know me, but I&rsquo;m a big, big fan of yours. I mean, <i>Blue Velvet</i>, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you for that one?</p>
<p><b>Isabella:</b> Aren&rsquo;t you with that girl over there? (points at Rachel, who waves back)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that&rsquo;s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I&rsquo;m allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it&rsquo;s flattery.</p>
<p><b>Isabella:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry. (starts to leave)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Isabella:</b> Yeah, for you. Is that the list?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Um, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Isabella:</b> May I see it?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Um, no.</p>
<p><b>Isabella:</b> Come on! (grabs the list)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> But, okay.</p>
<p><b>Isabella:</b> (reading it) I&rsquo;m not on the list!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Um, see, but that&rsquo;s not the final draft.</p>
<p><b>Isabella:</b> It&rsquo;s laminated!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler (Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.</p>
<p><b>Isabella:</b> Y&rsquo;know it&rsquo;s ironic&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Isabella:</b> &hellip;because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. (points at a guy and leaves)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to the rest of the gang) We&rsquo;re just gonna be friends.</p>

<h2>Closing Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, they are admiring the entertainment center</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&rsquo;know what?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Umm?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I bet &lsquo;ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;ve got five bucks says you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Get out your checkbook, mister.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I think I have the cash.</p>
<p>(Joey successfully enters the entertainment center, and Chandler closes the door on Joey.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You are dogged man! I totally fit!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors won&rsquo;t open) I&rsquo;m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks are on me!</p>
