<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s bedroom, he is giving Monica a massage.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t <b>believe</b> we&rsquo;ve never done this before! It&rsquo;s sooo good! So good for Monica!</p>
<p>(Chandler picks up the timer being used and turns it to zero at which it chimes.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh! Look at that, time&rsquo;s up! My turn!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That was a half an hour?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s your timer.</p>
<p>(They change places.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I don&rsquo;t like to brag about it, but I give the <b>best</b> massages!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, then massage me up right nice!</p>
<p>(She starts the massage, only she is doing extremely hard and Chandler is gasping in pain.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s so good, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s so good I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done to deserve it!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Say good-bye to sore muscles!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Good-bye muscles!!</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know what it was!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, for the first time in my life I&rsquo;m in a real relationship. Okay, I&rsquo;m not gonna screw that up by y&rsquo;know, telling the truth.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from the floor. It&rsquo;s one of those magician stovepipe hats.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh! Yeah, look there&rsquo;s this play all right? And I&rsquo;m up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y&rsquo;know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And you&rsquo;re gonna make them all disappear.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.</p>
<p>(Chandler picks up a basket from the table and puts it on his head.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Done.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, if you wanna look good, why don&rsquo;t you just come down to the store? I&rsquo;ll help you out.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Great! Thanks, Rach!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right.</p>
<p>(Both of them remove their hats as Phoebe enters.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, how&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.</p>
<p>(All at once.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Is everything okay?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you all right?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yeah, no-no-no. I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;m okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs! Sorry!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m never gonna see her again, y&rsquo;know she&rsquo;s gonna visit.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well maybe, maybe she&rsquo;s with us right now?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she&rsquo;s gonna come to the coffeehouse!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, Pheebs&rsquo; Grandmother just died.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh my God, I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s okay. Actually y&rsquo;know what, it&rsquo;s kinda cool. &rsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s like y&rsquo;know, one life ends and another begins.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to the guys) Not the way they&rsquo;re doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs, I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; &ldquo;Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I&rsquo;m gonna get the yogurt and we&rsquo;ll meet at the checkout counter.&rdquo; And y&rsquo;know what? We <b>will</b> meet at the checkout counter.</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: <i>Bloomingdale&rsquo;s</i>, Rachel is fixing Joey up with some new clothes.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay now Joey, y&rsquo;know that since you&rsquo;re returning all of this stuff right after the audition you&rsquo;re gonna have to wear underwear?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, then you&rsquo;d better show me some of that too then.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, it&rsquo;s missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Really? A purse?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&rsquo;s not a purse! It&rsquo;s a shoulder bag.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It looks like a women&rsquo;s purse.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, <b>men</b>, carrying the bag.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> See look, <b>women</b>, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women&rsquo;s purse looks good on me, a man.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Exactly! Unisex!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe you need sex. <b>I</b> had sex a couple days ago.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I ain&rsquo;t gonna say no to that.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ursula&rsquo;s apartment, Phoebe is about to break the bad news to her sister. She knocks on the door.</h3>
<p>Ursula: Who is it?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s Phoebe.</p>
<p>Ursula: Oh great! (Opens the door.) (Disappointed) Oh, you. Umm, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?</p>
<p>Ursula: Umm, yeah&mdash;no thanks.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, well, umm Grandma died.</p>
<p>Ursula: Wow! Didn&rsquo;t she die like five years ago?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we&rsquo;re having a memorial service tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ursula: Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No you didn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>Ursula: Well, then who&rsquo;s been dead for five years?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?</p>
<p>Ursula: Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I&rsquo;m going to a concert tomorrow. So&hellip; I&rsquo;d invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. (Starts to leave.)</p>
<p>Ursula: Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are on the couch as Joey enters with his new bag.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>
<p>(As he walks past both Chandler and Ross notice the bag and stare at each other in shock.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Are you referring to my man&rsquo;s bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it&rsquo;s practical too. Check it out! It&rsquo;s got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Your make-up!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You&rsquo;re audition is not until tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts eating.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, y&rsquo;know you get any mustard on that bag, you can&rsquo;t return it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Why would I return it? I love this bag!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, then you owe me $350.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He&rsquo;s holding the fake credit cards that come with the bag.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (glaring at him) Joey&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right relax, look I&rsquo;ll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What&rsquo;s the part, Anti-man?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, don&rsquo;t listen to them. I think it&rsquo;s sexy.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Phoebe&rsquo;s Grandmother&rsquo;s memorial, Phoebe is at the door welcoming people.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here&rsquo;s your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.</p>
<p>(The gang arrives.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi sweetie!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, how are you holding up?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Pheebs, I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (notices his bag.) Hey, y&rsquo;know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.</p>
<p>(Another man, an older man, enters, looking around and bumps into Chandler.)</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> Oops, I&rsquo;m sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?</p>
<p>(The gang moves off as Phoebe greets the new guest.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, welcome.</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> Hello. Hello.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm here&rsquo;s your 3-D glasses.</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> Oh, umm, all right.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So how did you know Francis?</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> Well I actually, I-I really, I haven&rsquo;t seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?! What&rsquo;s your name?</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> Umm, Frank Buffay.</p>
<p>(Needless to say, Phoebe is stunned into silence. And one audience member gasps.)</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> (Seeing the look on her face) Y&rsquo;know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You&rsquo;re Frank Buffay?</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Shh! (Whispers) No! Joe Hill!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You just said&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Y&rsquo;know what, I gotta go. And thank you <b>so</b> much for coming. (Hands back his glasses and hurries out.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But&hellip;</p>
<p>(Phoebe takes one step after him and stops.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?! What honey?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What happened?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That was my dad!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God!</p>
<p>(They all look down the hall he left from.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s coming right at me. (Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey&rsquo;s arm, which causes his hand to slap him in his face.)</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Funeral Home, continued from earlier. Phoebe is returning after looking for her father.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, did you catch him?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wh-what did he say?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He said, &ldquo;Nice to meet you Glenda.&rdquo; (They stare at her, dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn&rsquo;t give him my real name?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why?! Why not?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He&rsquo;s gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What did you say to him?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I said, I told him y&rsquo;know, that I was the executor person of Francis&rsquo; will and that I needed to talk to him so I&rsquo;m gonna meet him at the coffee house later.</p>
<p><b>The Pastor:</b> Could everyone please take their seats?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, well, I just can&rsquo;t think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, let&rsquo;s go say good-bye.</p>
<p>(They put on their glasses and try to find their way to their seats.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, after the funeral, everyone is there.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering, with bag) Hey! I&rsquo;m off to my audition. How do I look?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ahhh, I think you look <b>great</b>! That bag is gonna get you that part.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And a date with a man!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&rsquo;know what? Make fun all you want. <b>This</b> is a great bag! Okay? And it&rsquo;s as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don&rsquo;t understand something, doesn&rsquo;t make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, I&rsquo;d better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, no, not at first &rsquo;cause I-I don&rsquo;t want to freak him out</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, but aren&rsquo;t you pissed at him?! I mean this guy <b>abandoned</b> you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! (Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I&rsquo;d walk in there and I&rsquo;d be like, &ldquo;Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!&rdquo; (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, at least you scared someone.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know it&rsquo;s funny, you&rsquo;d <b>think</b> I&rsquo;d be angry. I mean, you&rsquo;d <b>think</b> I&rsquo;d wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I&rsquo;m past it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right.</p>
<p>(She goes over and tries to give Phoebe a massage. Phoebe yelps in pain and jumps away from her.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> As a masseuse and a human, I&rsquo;m begging you, never do that to anyone!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She starts giving Chandler a massage.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (seeing the look on Chandler&rsquo;s face) He-he does not like it! He hates it! He&rsquo;s in pain!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No he&rsquo;s not!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (wincing) Yes, he is!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry but, ow-owww-owww!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You&rsquo;ve been lying to me? I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d do that.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, maybe he just didn&rsquo;t want to hurt your feelings.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> But the minute we start to lie to each other&hellip; (Pauses after she realizes what she&rsquo;s saying.) And by &lsquo;we&rsquo; I mean society.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey&rsquo;s audition, he is with bag.</h3>
<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Any time you&rsquo;re ready, Joey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don&rsquo;t we get a table and I&rsquo;ll buy you a drink.</p>
<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> (stopping him) I&rsquo;m sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a question.)</p>
<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Sure. What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, first it&rsquo;s not a purse.</p>
<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Okay, anytime.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I mean if-if you&rsquo;re thinking it&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s bag, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s bag!</p>
<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Okayyyy! Anddd, go!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It&rsquo;s the latest thing! Everyone&rsquo;s got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone&rsquo;s carrying them!</p>
<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Umm, do you sell these bags?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.</p>
<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> Okay! Thank you! That was great!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah but I didn&rsquo;t read anything.</p>
<p><b>The Casting Director:</b> I think we&rsquo;ve seen enough!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay! All right, I&rsquo;ll see ya. (As he&rsquo;s walking off stage.) (Patting the bag.) We got it! We got it!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Chandler is poking his head in.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, is Rachel here?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y&rsquo;know? I-I really like &rsquo;em.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, please, stop! Look, we&rsquo;re supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me&mdash;just say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like your massages.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (falling into that trap) I don&rsquo;t like your massages.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (starting to cry) See? It&rsquo;s no big deal.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but now see you&rsquo;re crying!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m not crying about that! I&rsquo;m crying about something that happened at work.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn&rsquo;t like my massages.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s okay, you don&rsquo;t have to be the best at everything.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! You don&rsquo;t know me at all!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m crying here!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the <b>best</b> bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the best of that?&rdquo; They&rsquo;d have to go to you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Huh. So you&rsquo;re saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you&rsquo;d get all the votes!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Absolutely!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. I suck!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! (They hug.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Frank Sr. is just arriving.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, thank you for meeting with me.</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Thank you. All right.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come, sit. (He&rsquo;s hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on the arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I just&mdash;I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> So, what did Francis leave me?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Well, that&rsquo;s why you wanted me to come, right?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yes. Yes. Yeah&mdash;no. She did. She left you umm, (looking in her purse) this lipstick.</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Oh. Huh. It&rsquo;s huh, well it&rsquo;s (opens it) oh it&rsquo;s&mdash;ew used. Umm, cool.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I&rsquo;m going to get out my official forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis&rsquo; daughter Lilly, is that correct?</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Yes, yes I was.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> It really says that?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hmm, okay, <b>total</b> abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you&rsquo;re just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I don&rsquo;t think I want the lipstick that much. (Gets up to leave.) But umm&hellip; Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please? (Hands her a note.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But you-you-you came to see Lilly?</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Yeah, yeah. Why?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Lilly&rsquo;s dead. (He looks up in shock.)</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> She what?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Are you sure?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, if she isn&rsquo;t then cremating her was a <b>big</b> mistake.</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe this. I just&mdash;I can&rsquo;t believe this. How-how&mdash;Oh my God. How long ago?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> 17 years ago.</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Oh! What about, what about the girls?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, (pause) is on this couch.</p>
<p>(Silence ensues.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, (Sits down next to her and brushes against her leg.) Oops. (He backs up.) I just, I-I-I-I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I just can&rsquo;t believe that you&rsquo;re my daughter, you&rsquo;re so pretty.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes. Well, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know what, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say it&rsquo;s not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> All right. Well, y&rsquo;know in my defense I was a lousy father.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&rsquo;s a defense?</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You make up songs?</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let&rsquo;s see, how did it, how did it go. Umm. (Singing.)</p>
<p><i>Sleepy girl, sleepy girl.<br> Why won&rsquo;t you go to sleep?<br> Sleepy girl, sleepy girl.<br> You&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re keeping me uppp!</i> (Yeah, that&rsquo;s to the tune of Smelly Cat.)</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(Phoebe is trying not to smile. He moves closer and very shyly holds out his hand and turns his head, hoping for Phoebe to take his hand. She doesn&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p><b>Frank Sr.:</b> I just, I y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;m not very good at this. So, umm&hellip; (Backs away.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)</p>
<p>(She holds his hand for a little while then&hellip;)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)</p>

<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey man, how did the audition go?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Estelle said I didn&rsquo;t get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What kind of problem?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t wanna give up the bag. I don&rsquo;t have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? (She&rsquo;s avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!</p>
