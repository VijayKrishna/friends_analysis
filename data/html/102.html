<p class="scene">[Scene Central Perk, everyone&rsquo;s there.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What you guys don&rsquo;t understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, right!&hellip;&hellip;Y&rsquo;serious?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y&rsquo;know? I mean it&rsquo;s like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, and-and it&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t like the comedian, it&rsquo;s that-that&hellip; that&rsquo;s not why we bought the ticket.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> The problem is, though, after the concert&rsquo;s over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y&rsquo;know? I mean, we&rsquo;re in the car, we&rsquo;re fighting traffic&hellip; basically just trying to stay awake.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you&rsquo;re gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (pause)&hellip;Are we still talking about sex?</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Museum of Prehistoric History, Ross and a co-worker (Marsha) are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it&rsquo;s good, it is good, it&rsquo;s just that- mm- doesn&rsquo;t she seem a little angry?</p>
<p><b>Marsha:</b> Well, she has issues.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Does she.</p>
<p><b>Marsha:</b> He&rsquo;s out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like &lsquo;Gee, that glacier&rsquo;s getting kinda close.&rsquo; See?</p>
<p><b>Marsha:</b> Speaking of issues, isn&rsquo;t that your ex-wife?</p>
<p>(Carol, Ross&rsquo;s ex-wife, has entered behind them and is standing outstide the exhibit.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (trying to ignore her) No. No.</p>
<p><b>Marsha:</b> Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I&rsquo;ll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.</p>
<p>(Marsha extis and Ross waves Carol into the exhibit.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b>Hi.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> So.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You look great. I, uh&hellip; I hate that.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Sorry. You look good too.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, well, in here, anyone who&hellip; stands erect&hellip; So what&rsquo;s new? Still, uh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> A lesbian?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well&hellip; you never know. How&rsquo;s, um.. how&rsquo;s the family?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Marty&rsquo;s still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why- why are you here, Carol?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> I&rsquo;m pregnant.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Pregnant?!</p>
<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are watching <em>Three&rsquo;s Company</em>.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I think this is the episode of Three&rsquo;s Company where there&rsquo;s some kind of misunderstanding.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b>&hellip;Then I&rsquo;ve already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Whose little ball of paper is this?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn&rsquo;t need it, so I balled it up and&hellip; (sees that Monica is glaring at him) &hellip;now I wish I was dead.</p>
<p>(Monica starts to fluff a pillow.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She&rsquo;s already fluffed that pillow&hellip; Monica, you know, you&rsquo;ve already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it&rsquo;s fine!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look , I&rsquo;m sorry, guys, I just don&rsquo;t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child&rsquo;s pillow.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you&rsquo;re scaring me. I mean, you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, calm down. You don&rsquo;t see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y&rsquo;see, he&rsquo;s the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Eeaagh!</p>
<p>(Rachel enters from her room.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Has anybody seen my engagement ring?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God&hellip; (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, look, don&rsquo;t touch that!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, like I wasn&rsquo;t dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him&hellip; &ldquo;Hi Barry! Remember me? I&rsquo;m the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!&rdquo; Oh God and now I&rsquo;m gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Easy Rach, we&rsquo;ll find it. (To all) Won&rsquo;t we!</p>
<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> Oh! Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright, when&rsquo;d&rsquo;ya have it on last?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Doy! Probably right before she lost it!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You don&rsquo;t get a lot of &rsquo;doy&rsquo; these days&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;Dinah?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don&rsquo;t be mad&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I am sorry&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Now, Monica, you know that&rsquo;s not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (puts down the lasagne) I just&hellip; can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Boys? We&rsquo;re going in.</p>
<p>(Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe start to pick through the lasagne as there&rsquo;s a knock on the door which Monica answers.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (standing outside the door)&hellip;Hi.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow. That is not a happy hi.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Carol&rsquo;s pregnant.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> W-w-wh-&hellip; wha-&hellip; w-w-w-&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I&rsquo;m not comfortable with it, I don&rsquo;t have to be involved.. basically it&rsquo;s entirely up to me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She is so great! I miss her.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What does she mean by &lsquo;involved&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So what are you gonna do?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I&rsquo;m still gonna be a father.</p>
<p>(Joey starts to eat the rest of the lasagne and everyone turns and stares at him.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &hellip;Well, this is still ruined, right?</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene, Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica and Ross are pouring wine for their parents.]</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh, Martha Ludwin&rsquo;s daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What&rsquo;s that curry taste?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Curry.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Mmmm!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I- I think they&rsquo;re great! I, I really do.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> They all had a thing for him.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Aw, Mom&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, why is this girl going to call me?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No Mom, I don&rsquo;t have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Well, they don&rsquo;t have to know that&hellip; (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh, we&rsquo;re having spaghetti! That&rsquo;s&hellip; easy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.</p>
<p>[Time Lapse, everyone is now eating.]</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> What that Rachel did to her life&hellip; We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I&rsquo;m not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding&hellip; but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Nothing! It&rsquo;s an expression.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Don&rsquo;t listen to your mother. You&rsquo;re independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid&hellip; and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles&hellip;</p>
<p>[Time Lapse.]</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I&rsquo;m telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.</p>
<p>[Time Lapse.]</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> &hellip;And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God &lsquo;Our Little Harmonica&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem to have that problem.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what&rsquo;s going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here&rsquo;s the deal. Carol&rsquo;s a lesbian. She&rsquo;s living with a woman named Susan. She&rsquo;s pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.</p>
<p>(Stunned silence ensues.)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> (To Monica) And you knew about this?!</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Park, everyone&rsquo;s there.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Your folks are really that bad, huh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, y&rsquo;know, these people are pros. They know what they&rsquo;re doing, they take their time, they get the job done.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Boy, I know they say you can&rsquo;t change your parents,&hellip; boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I&rsquo;d want yours.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Must pee. (Goes to pee.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s even worse when you&rsquo;re twins.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You&rsquo;re twins?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. We don&rsquo;t speak. She&rsquo;s like this high-powered, driven career type.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What does she do?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She&rsquo;s a waitress.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, you&rsquo;re an only child, right? You don&rsquo;t have any of this.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who&hellip; my parents actually preferred.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> The lights, please..</p>
<p>(Joey turns off the lights, and they all leave as Rachel starts to clean up. Ross enters from the bathroom.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &hellip;How long was I in there?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m just cleaning up.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> D&rsquo;ya.. uh.. d&rsquo;ya need any help?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.. a little..</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Mm-hmm..</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> A lot.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Mm.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, got any advice? Y&rsquo;know, as someone who&rsquo;s recently been- dumped?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word &lsquo;dumped&rsquo;. Chances are he&rsquo;s gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y&rsquo;know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it&rsquo;ll be hard. Or, y&rsquo;know, uh, hey!, I&rsquo;ll go down there, and I&rsquo;ll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you&rsquo;ve got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Got me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Remember when we were in high school together?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean, didn&rsquo;t you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that&rsquo;d be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes, yes!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Man, I never thought I&rsquo;d be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Me either&hellip; (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn&rsquo;t have to move his hand.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Carol&rsquo;s OB/GYN, Carol is waiting.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Sorry I&rsquo;m late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.</p>
<p>(Susan enters holding a drink.)</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Ross, you remember Susan.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> How could I forget?</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Ross.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we&rsquo;re just waiting for&hellip;?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Dr. Oberman.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> She.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Yes, and she&rsquo;s very supportive.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, that&rsquo;s great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I&rsquo;m- Oh.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.)</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene Barry&rsquo;s office, Barry is working on patient, Robbie, as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Bernice:</b> (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein&rsquo;s gagging.</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> (answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back in a sec.</p>
<p>(As Barry exits Robbie stares at Rachel.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I dumped him.</p>
<p><b>Robbie:</b> Okay.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Carol&rsquo;s OB/GYN, they&rsquo;re talking about how this is going to work.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So, um- so how&rsquo;s this, uh, how&rsquo;s this gonna work? Y&rsquo;know, with us? Y&rsquo;know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Give me a &lsquo;for instance&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, uh, uh, I don&rsquo;t know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby&rsquo;s name?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Marlon?!</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> -if it&rsquo;s a boy, Minnie if it&rsquo;s a girl.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &hellip;As in Mouse?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> As in my grandmother.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Julia..</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> We agreed on Minnie.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &rsquo;s&rsquo;funny, um, uh, we agreed we&rsquo;d spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia&rsquo;s on the table&hellip;?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Barry&rsquo;s office, Rachel is doing her makeup in the mirror on Barry&rsquo;s lamp as Barry enters.</h3>
<p><b>Barry:</b> Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, not much. I-I got a job.</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> Oh, that&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p><b>Barry:</b> Careful! They haven&rsquo;t quite taken yet.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And you&rsquo;ve got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay..</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I&rsquo;m an orthodontist.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren&rsquo;t happy. But with Mindy, now I&rsquo;m happy. Spit.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Robbie:</b> Me. (Spits.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Helen Geller? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Hello? It&rsquo;s not gonna be Helen Geller.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> No, I mean it&rsquo;s not Geller.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What, it&rsquo;s gonna be Helen Willick?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> It&rsquo;s my baby too.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, &rsquo;s&rsquo;funny, really? Um, I don&rsquo;t remember you making any sperm.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> All right, you two, stop it!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I&rsquo;m in there too.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Ross. You&rsquo;re not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? &rsquo;Cause I think that borders on child abuse.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Of course not, I&rsquo;m&hellip; suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he&rsquo;s doing? He knows no-one&rsquo;s gonna say all those names, so they&rsquo;ll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y&rsquo;know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I&rsquo;m not, I can&rsquo;t do-</p>
<p><b>Dr. Oberman:</b> (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Yeah. Yeah. A little.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Oberman:</b> Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back..</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You- uh- y&rsquo;know what, I&rsquo;m gonna go. I don&rsquo;t- I don&rsquo;t think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.</p>
<p>(He turns to go, but the sound of the sonogram catches hes ear. He returns and stares at it.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> Look at that.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> I know.</p>

<h2>Closing Credits</h2>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What are we supposed to be seeing here?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I dunno, but.. I think it&rsquo;s about to attack the Enterprise.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.</p>

I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y&rsquo;know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.
