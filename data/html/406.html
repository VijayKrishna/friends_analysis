<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross and a beautiful blonde (Cheryl) are standing outside. The rest of the gang is watching from inside.</h3>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> So, thank you for the delicious dinner.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re welcome for a delicious dinner.</p>
<p>[inside]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey what are you guys looking at?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ross and the most beautiful girl in <i>the world</i>.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, come to papa.</p>
<p>[Cheryl walks away and Ross walks inside. Everyone stares at him in disbelief.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Probably the only time I&rsquo;ll ever say this, but did you see the <i>ass</i> on her?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where did you, when did you, how did you&hellip; (Joey hits the back of Chandler&rsquo;s head) How did you get a girl like that?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, so what is she, like a&hellip; like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Actually she&rsquo;s a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but that&rsquo;s, like, the easiest era.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;ve seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we&rsquo;re going out again tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine by me; hope she wins.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s. Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oo! Is it for my birthday present?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn&rsquo;t come yet?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I have a call in about that.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &rsquo;kay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Actually, this is for Kathy&rsquo;s birthday. It&rsquo;s an early edition of her favorite book.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, <i>The Velveteen Rabbit</i>! Oh my God, when the boy&rsquo;s love makes the rabbit real!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, but don&rsquo;t touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh. Well, then you&rsquo;d better keep it away from Ross&rsquo;s hair.<B></b> So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers&hellip; called a couple of the author&rsquo;s grandchildren.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, honey, that&rsquo;s so sweet.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate&rsquo;s girlfriend!"</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It doesn&rsquo;t say that. Does it?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> How do you think it&rsquo;s gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful <i>and</i> expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, all right, I&rsquo;ll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! What happened?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Sixty <i>guests</i>.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Because I don&rsquo;t have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican&rsquo;t , not Monican&hellip; (Monica looks almost puzzled) &hellip;Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> There you go, that&rsquo;s the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really? Cause I&rsquo;d need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay! It&rsquo;s worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven&rsquo;t worked in months.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, you&rsquo;re not working either.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, but I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, that&rsquo;d be great! Thank you!</p>
<p>[Joey enters]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Everyone:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Why?</p>
<p>[Kathy whispers something in Joey&rsquo;s ear]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You can pee here!</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Ahahaha&hellip; haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s okay, the duck&rsquo;s using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We&rsquo;ve only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?</p>
<p><b>Everyone:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I know&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."</p>
<p>[cut to a new scene, also in Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Rachel is sitting, Phoebe is nearby.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! I&rsquo;m sorry, honey, it&rsquo;s just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine. But you can&rsquo;t help me develop my new universal language.</p>
<p>[Monica enters]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, how&rsquo;d it go?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow&mdash;the dead-guy-from-today&rsquo;s best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Mon! I&rsquo;m so happy for you!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.<B></b> (Picks up two frying pans) Look at this! I&rsquo;m an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;ll have one, please. Plus my money.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. Well, I didn&rsquo;t realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I&hellip; I used it to buy all this stuff. But look&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got another job tomorrow, so I&rsquo;ll pay you back with the money I make from that.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Outside Cheryl&rsquo;s apartment, Ross and Cheryl are kissing</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (moved by the kiss) Huh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> Um, would you like to come in?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> According to recent findings!</p>
<p>[They go into the apartment. Inside the apartment it looks like a sewage dump exploded and landed in her living room. There are clothes and food and junk covering every square inch of space. I mean pigs have nicer pens. Ross is completely shocked.]</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> (throwing food around the room) Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Mitzi is&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> My hamster. I hope she&rsquo;s okay, I haven&rsquo;t seen her in a while. Have a seat.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (mouths "where?") Uh&hellip; Oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbage and falters) &hellip;do you have any<B>,</b> um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I do! Why don&rsquo;t we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> I&rsquo;d rather not.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah, why not?</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> Okay, um, don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A kitchen where Phoebe and Monica are finishing up a catering job</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, is everything in the car?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes. Did you settle the bill?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No. I hate this part.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, that&rsquo;s not mine.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!</p>
<p>[cut to the living room of the same dwelling, where the funeral guests are mingling. Monica enters.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we&rsquo;re all cleaned up in the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Burkart:</b> Oh, good. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Um, and, well there&rsquo;s the.. the the small matter of&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Burkart:</b> Dear?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Just the matter of &hellip;payment?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (in grief) Jack used to handle the finances! (Breaks into tears)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is on the couch still doing the crossword. Chandler is in the kitchen.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (confused) Sure&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; um, Grease?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Rent?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! Rent!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so when do you want to go?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m busy.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, it is, at <i>Office Max</i>.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> A <i>pen</i>.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s two gifts in one. It&rsquo;s a pen that&rsquo;s also a clock! Huh?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Huh-huh! You can&rsquo;t give her that.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Why not?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because she&rsquo;s not eleven! And it&rsquo;s not the seventh night of Hanukkah!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, honey, what he means by that, is &hellip;while this is a very nice gift, maybe it&rsquo;s just not something a boyfriend gives?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she&rsquo;s writing, she turns it over&hellip; "Whoa! It&rsquo;s time for my date with Joey!"</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look, look. What did&hellip; what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> She didn&rsquo;t have a birthday while we were going out.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> For three years?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (whining and heading toward the door) Look, it&rsquo;s too late, and I got an audition. I can&rsquo;t shop anymore! I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks, man. And oh, while you&rsquo;re at it, could you get her a card?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Or&hellip; just get a card that has a poem already in it.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Back in the kitchen at the funeral. Phoebe is there, Monica enters.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But Mon, you have to get our money!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Phoebe, she couldn&rsquo;t stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know, it&rsquo;s tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother&rsquo;s funeral was?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Pay the caterer! Look, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It&rsquo;s either, you know, "that massage wasn&rsquo;t long enough, or, "I don&rsquo;t recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren&rsquo;t big enough. Bad little white girl!"</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. So what do you&hellip; you think she&rsquo;s faking?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it seems like there weren&rsquo;t any tears &rsquo;til you showed her the bill.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.</p>
<p>[cut to the living room where Mrs. Burkart is now performing.]</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (singing) You&rsquo;re a grand ol&rsquo; flag, you&rsquo;re a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She seems fine now.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (singing) &hellip;emblem of the land I love. The home of&hellip;</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Ross and Joey are standing and talking, Ross is tying a tie.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it&rsquo;s a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it&rsquo;s a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it&rsquo;s the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to Joey who puts it on.) Here.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, so&hellip; next time, you take her to your place.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What kind of smell?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. <i>Soap</i>?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, listen, Ross&hellip; you like this girl, right?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You wanna see her again, right?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So you&rsquo;re gonna have to do it in the mess!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, okay you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I mean, uh, who&hellip; who cares about a little sloppiness?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s, uh&hellip; it&rsquo;s endearing, really.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure) Oink!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel, Rachel is there, Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than <i>the rabbit</i>.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Any luck?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, look. Why don&rsquo;t you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like&hellip; a regular pen.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> She&rsquo;s really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don&rsquo;t get to be the one who gives it to her.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aw, honey, that&rsquo;s so sweet.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah? You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just pathetic?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey! I&rsquo;m meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I&rsquo;ve been looking all over for you!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Our place, the hall! I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can&rsquo;t hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It&rsquo;s a book!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that&rsquo;s also a safe?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it&rsquo;s a book that&rsquo;s just a book, okay? It&rsquo;s an early edition of the <i>Velveteen Rabbit</i>. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just&hellip; let me know if she likes it, okay?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves, comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn&rsquo;t any change from that twenty, was there?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it came out to an even twenty.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow. That&rsquo;s almost as much as a <i>new</i> book.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> In the living room at the funeral</h3>
<p><b>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (singing) Jeepers, creepers, where&rsquo;d you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where&rsquo;d you get those eyes?</p>
<p>[cut to Monica and Phoebe in the kitchen]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You didn&rsquo;t get the money, did you?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on&hellip; you know what? Let&rsquo;s just go!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! Hey, we&rsquo;re not leaving until we get paid! I don&rsquo;t know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (Singing) Come on along and listen to&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, Widow!</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Burkart:</b> (Singing) &hellip;the lullabye of&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we&rsquo;re paid every penny. &rsquo;Cause you know what, lady? We&rsquo;re part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Burkart:</b> All right. I&rsquo;ll get my bag.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica with everyone staring at her.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Outside Cheryl&rsquo;s apartment.</h3>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> So you want to come inside?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (mustering up courage) Yes. Yes I do. (They go inside.)</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> I&rsquo;ll be right back. Make yourself comfortable. (Ross attempts to clear a place for his coat and fold it small enough to fit. Then hit sits on the couch. Something falls on him from above and he brushes his neck off frantically.)</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> (sneaking up behind Ross) Guess who?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Department of Sanitation?</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> It&rsquo;s me!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! (She kisses him) Ah. (They kiss more, and move down onto the couch. Ross&rsquo;s hand moves under some garbage) Aw! (His hand is covered with something brown and gooey.)</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (trying to make his disgust into lust) Ah, Cheryl!</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> Oh, Ross!</p>
<p>[They sit up, moaning in excitement, and Cheryl straddles Ross. Ross finds a slice of bologna and moans higher and louder, then a bag of potato chips on the coffee table starts to move. Ross throws Cheryl off his lap, grabs a tennis racket and a toilet brush and starts pounding the bag.]</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> Wait! No! No! It&rsquo;s my hamster! It&rsquo;s Mitzi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my god! I&rsquo;m so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> (looking in the bag) Oh, thank god, it&rsquo;s not Mitzi. It&rsquo;s just a rat.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk. Rachel is sitting on the couch alone. Gunther is there, going into the back room.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there&rsquo;s nobody to hug!</p>
<p>[From the background we hear a crash and Gunther comes running out of the back room, pushing people aside, reaching for Rachel.]</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Move!</p>
<p>[Gunther slips and falls just before reaching the back of the couch. Monica and Phoebe come into Central Perk.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!</p>
<p>[Gunther gets up slowly from behind the couch and walks away sadly]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh&hellip; yay!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thanks!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, that&rsquo;s great! Congratulations!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you! Hey, how&rsquo;d the catering go?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn&rsquo;t pay, so Phoebe yelled at her &rsquo;til she did.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. I&rsquo;m a hard ass.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And I&rsquo;m a wuss. And we should be partners.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute, Phoebe! We <i>should</i> be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You&rsquo;re not working right now, and we have such a great time together!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can cook and you can take care of the money.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Oh! It&rsquo;ll be like I have a wife in the fifties!</p>
<p><b>Both:</b> (screaming with excitement) Aah!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is there, Joey enters.</h3>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah? That&rsquo;s great!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> [nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh&hellip;</p>
<p>[Kathy enters]</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! Happy birthday.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You know, uh&hellip; [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got you a gift, too.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No he didn&rsquo;t. [Moving it back.]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, he did, look&hellip; look, it&rsquo;s right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Happy birthday! I&rsquo;m <i>sorry</i>.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> You really didn&rsquo;t have to. (Opens the box) Wow.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> See, you think it&rsquo;s just a pen, but then you turn it over and it&rsquo;s also a <i>clock</i>.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. (They hug).</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah&hellip; yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah. Hm. (To Kathy) Wanna go to bed?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> I&rsquo;ll be in in a minute.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, uh&hellip; don&rsquo;t forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. Then goes inside).</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> [to Kathy] Goodnight.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Um, thank you for the gift.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, uh, yeah&hellip; I just knew that sometimes when you&rsquo;re writing, you&hellip; you don&rsquo;t always know the exact time.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> No, I&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t mean the pen. Thank you for the book.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, the book?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> <i>The Velveteen Rabbit.</i> I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is &rsquo;cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> You must really like&hellip; Joey&hellip; to go to all that trouble for him.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi. Uh, you&hellip; you don&rsquo;t know me, I&rsquo;m Monica Geller&hellip; Ross&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p><b>Cheryl:</b> Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that&rsquo;s too bad that didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?</p>
<p>[Cheryl shrugs, shuts the door, looking puzzled]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No?</p>
<p>[Monica looks around the hallway, pulls out a sponge and starts scrubbing the door frame.]</p>
