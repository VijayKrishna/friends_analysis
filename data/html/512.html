<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is trying to pry more information about Chandler and Monica from Joey who&rsquo;s sitting on the couch and busy downing a pizza.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on Joey!!!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you would say that!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! I mean come on! This is a <b>huge</b> deal! (She sits next to him on the couch.) Fine I want&mdash;I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (thinks) I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Is he romantic with her?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are they in love?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (thinks) I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh, I know one thing!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> They did it right there on the couch.</p>
<p>(He points to where she&rsquo;s sitting and she jumps up quickly.)</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, everyone is there as Ross enters.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Ross!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it&rsquo;s my ex-wife Emily!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> What? Oh!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sorry man.</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Here&rsquo;s your scone.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it&rsquo;s on to Rachel, sets it down on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Did they teach you that in your anger management class?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can&rsquo;t be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s mad about that.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Exactly! Because it&rsquo;s in the past!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s office, Monica and him are at a party his office is throwing.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don&rsquo;t have to hide.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)</p>
<p>(They both stand real close together.)</p>
<p><b>Both:</b> We can&rsquo;t do that. (They separate.)</p>
<p>(Chandler&rsquo;s boss (Doug) walks up.)</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Hey Bing! (Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica) Wo-ho-ho, who&rsquo;s the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi, nice to meet you!</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Hi! And this is my wife Kara.</p>
<p><b>Kara:</b> Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! (Slaps Chandler on his butt.)</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, sir.</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.</p>
<p>(Chandler does a fake laugh.)</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Come on honey, let&rsquo;s go drink our body weight. (They walk off leaving Chandler and Monica alone.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What was that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That noise you just made?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that was my work laugh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really? Your work laugh?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you&rsquo;re gonna have to come up with one too.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, check me out.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p>(She walks up to where Doug is finishing another joke to another group.)</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> &hellip;says $30 Father; same as in town.</p>
<p>(Monica does a fake laugh. For the laughs, you&rsquo;ll have to see the episode. I can&rsquo;t describe them.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Monica is buying a muffin as Chandler runs in.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> <b>And</b>! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He&rsquo;s never even <b>talked</b> to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway, I&rsquo;m gonna go try and find a racquet.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, I thought you already had one.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at&hellip;bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh umm, y&rsquo;know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Monica) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&rsquo;s up?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y&rsquo;know I-I feel that we don&rsquo;t talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uhh, not much. Uh, work&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh y&rsquo;know what, we don&rsquo;t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. Umm&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Y&rsquo;know what? Let&rsquo;s talk about relationships!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, what&rsquo;s going on with you?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nothing! You go!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I-I&mdash;there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don&rsquo;t anymore.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow that&rsquo;s uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y&rsquo;know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if&mdash;are you sure there&rsquo;s just not anything else?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes, I&rsquo;m sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler, Joey, and Ross&rsquo;s, Phoebe is settling a dispute between the chick and the duck.</h3>
<p>(The duck quacks.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, then what happened?</p>
<p>(The duck flaps its wings frantically.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You&rsquo;ll get your turn!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This is not over!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! No!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it&rsquo;s all covered in-in&hellip; (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh actually, I think I&rsquo;m gonna skip it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s okay, Joe.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, let&rsquo;s go Pheebs.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A tennis court somewhere in the city of New York, it&rsquo;s the doubles match-up of a century Chandler and Monica versus Doug and Kara.</h3>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Bing!</p>
<p>(Hits the ball towards Chandler who returns it back to him. He then hits the ball at Monica who slams it and it bounces off Kara&rsquo;s leg.)</p>
<p><b>Kara:</b> Oww!!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Game!</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. (To his wife.) Are you all right sweethart?</p>
<p><b>Kara:</b> (out of breath and mouths) I&rsquo;m not all right.</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> We&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re just gonna get a little sip of water.</p>
<p>(They both walk off the court.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t understand what you just said.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Let them win one.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at &lsquo;um, he can&rsquo;t breath and she&rsquo;s popping pills.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re not even giving them a chance!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> They have racquets don&rsquo;t they?!</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Uh Bing, I think we&rsquo;re gonna make this the last game.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? (Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;ll take it down to 95% but that&rsquo;s the best I can do.</p>
<p>(She serves to Doug who returns it to Chandler. As it bounces over his head Chandler swings and misses.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oopsey, missed it!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and Kara and scores a point.)</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Nice shot.</p>
<p>(Chandler glares at her and she shrugs her shoulders. Monica serves again; and Kara returns it.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I got it!!</p>
<p>(Chandler cuts in front of her and hits the ball high and long.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica and Chandler are returning from the game.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you let them win!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I was frustrated.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It was my racquet.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I was frustrated with you!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> If we hadn&rsquo;t lost the game they never would&rsquo;ve invented us to dinner tomorrow night.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know what really bothers me? Is&mdash;it&rsquo;s how-how different you act around them! I mean y&rsquo;know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you around, Bing!&rdquo; &ldquo;Not if I see you first, Doug!&rdquo; (Mocks the fake laugh.) I gotta tell you, I don&rsquo;t like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy&rsquo;s a suck-up.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay y&rsquo;know what, because you said that, I&rsquo;m not putting out tonight.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler, Joey, and Ross&rsquo;s, the next morning the girls are there with Joey.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m telling you, something&rsquo;s wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe we should check the trash chute.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross couldn&rsquo;t fit down the trash chute.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.</p>
<p>(Ross enters.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> There he is!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.) Where the hell have you been?!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Just, y&rsquo;know out.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, out, oh God, I don&rsquo;t know why we didn&rsquo;t think to check there!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What were you doing?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You walked around all night in the city by yourself?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I don&rsquo;t have to answer your questions! Okay? I&rsquo;m a big boy, I can do whatever I want!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> He hooked up!! Tell us about her!</p>
<p>[Suddenly the door opens and Ross&rsquo;s mystery girl enters. I&rsquo;ll give you a hint to who it is: OH&hellip;MY&hellip;GAWD!! Uh-huh, it&rsquo;s Janice.]</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> (entering) Ross you left you scarf in&hellip;(sees everyone.) Hey you guys. (Does the laugh.)</p>
<p>(They all turn and with shocked looks on their faces stare at Ross. Ross is at a loss for words at this moment.)</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler, Joey, and Ross&rsquo;s, continued from earlier.</h3>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in <b>Yemen</b>! I&rsquo;m a young woman! I have needs! I can&rsquo;t wait forever!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! No that&rsquo;s what I was thinking.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> So I&rsquo;m asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, nobody&rsquo;s judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh! Okay! (To Ross) You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! (Does her famous, or is that infamous, laugh and exits.)</p>
<p>(They all turn and glare at Ross.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You two will have very hairy children.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I didn&rsquo;t know you would say that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross! Janice?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He&rsquo;s our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I <b>didn&rsquo;t</b> lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We&rsquo;ve-we&rsquo;ve both been divorced. We-we both have kids.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So are you actually gonna see her again?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Phoebe! Don&rsquo;t put ideas in his head!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I <b>am</b> gonna see her again.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Damnit Phoebe!!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica is going through her purse as Rachel rushes in.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> My turn? What-what are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just tell Rachel that I&rsquo;m doing laundry for a couple of hours.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Laundry? Is <b>that</b> my new nickname?&rdquo; And you said, &ldquo;No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well. Sounds like you&rsquo;re writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big&hellip;(Thinks)&hellip;ot.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Mr. Bigot. He tells the most <b>racist</b> jokes.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right. So you&rsquo;re telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler, Joey, and Ross&rsquo;s, Phoebe and Joey are there.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. Let&rsquo;s get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that&rsquo;s over the duck and the laundry basket that&rsquo;s over the chicken.) And they&rsquo;re off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Judge rules, no violation.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohhh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey guys!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p>(Neither of them turns around from watching the chick and the duck look for the tasty treat.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&rsquo;know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!</p>
<p>(They both turn around.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Are you serious?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that&rsquo;s been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You don&rsquo;t need Janice for that, you&rsquo;ve got us. We&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that&rsquo;s not a Nutter-Butter, that&rsquo;s just an old Wonton!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, tough call.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Doug&rsquo;s house, Chandler, Monica, and them are just finishing dinner.</h3>
<p><b>Doug:</b> But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill. (Chandler does the laugh.)</p>
<p><b>Kara:</b> So how do you kids like your coffee?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, none for me. Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Just a little bit of sugar.</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Well, maybe I&rsquo;ll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh? (Once again, with the laugh.)</p>
<p>(Doug and Kara go get the coffee.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, you get used to it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I-I-I don&rsquo;t think that I can. So if you don&rsquo;t mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So I laugh at my boss&rsquo;s jokes, what&rsquo;s the big deal?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;d rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> (entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara&rsquo;s coffee. Y&rsquo;know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it&rsquo;s not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not laugh.) Did you hear what I said Bing?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> The joke Bing. What&rsquo;s the matter with you?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I-I just didn&rsquo;t think it was funny sir.</p>
<p><b>Doug:</b> Excuse me?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I just&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (interrupting) Honey, I just don&rsquo;t think that you understood the joke.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don&rsquo;t think you got it. You see Kara&rsquo;s coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I thought you could use the help.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is going through the mail as Joey enters.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure! Why?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it&rsquo;s kinda hard to concentrate.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That&rsquo;s it! Y&rsquo;know what? I&rsquo;m just gonna go over there and confront them right now!</p>
<p>[Cut to Chandler, Joey, and Ross&rsquo;s apartment, Rachel enters and sneaks up to Chandler&rsquo;s bedroom where she overhears Chandler and Monica talking.]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (from his bedroom) All right, so you&rsquo;re telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Sorry! I&rsquo;m just&mdash;I&rsquo;m not very good at this! I&rsquo;m a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> But we&rsquo;re not ready to tell yet!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know! It&rsquo;s just that&hellip;ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y&rsquo;know? I miss that so much now. She&rsquo;s my best friend.</p>
<p>(Rachel decides not to confront them and starts to walk out, knocking over a lamp in the process.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Hi!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she&rsquo;s wearing men&rsquo;s boxers.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I was actually&mdash;I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y&rsquo;know, see them a little better.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay great!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler&rsquo;s room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I&rsquo;m at my new work.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I&rsquo;m gonna go look at my books!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;ll get back to my new job.</p>
<p>(Pause.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> &rsquo;kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and is almost in tears.)</p>
<p>(After she exits, Chandler enters.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Man, she is really gullible.</p>
<p>(Monica motions that it went right over Rachel&rsquo;s head.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross and Janice are sitting on the couch.</h3>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Here you go. (Serves them both some coffee.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks!</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Actually, I should get going.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I&rsquo;m on sabbatical from work, right?</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Yes! Yes! You did!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> What is wrong now?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> This isn&rsquo;t what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee&mdash;ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Sometimes I feel&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> No-no-no, no. <b>I&rsquo;m</b> going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> (starting to cry) You&rsquo;re a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don&rsquo;t think I can take another second of you whining!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Let-let me make sure I&rsquo;m hearing this right, you&rsquo;re ending this with me because <b>I&rsquo;m</b> too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you&rsquo;re saying, I&rsquo;ve become so whiney that <b>I</b> annoy <b>you</b>, Janice.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Well yeah!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> OH&hellip;MY&hellip;GOD!!</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Are you gonna be okay?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I am now.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Okay.</p>
<p>(Joey enters.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Umm, hi.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh hi! Well, I guess that&rsquo;s two out of three, Joey. (Laughs and exits.)</p>
<p>(Joey looks at Ross with a horrified look on his face.)</p>
<p><b>Ending Credits</b></p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler, Joey, and Ross&rsquo;s, Chandler is reading a magazine as Ross hands him a beer.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Dude, we got to talk.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn&rsquo;t too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real laugh this time.) What you&rsquo;re-you&rsquo;re not mad?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why would I be mad?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, because y&rsquo;know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don&rsquo;t uh, you don&rsquo;t fool around with your uh, friend&rsquo;s ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they&rsquo;re related to.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you know what I&rsquo;m gonna do? I&rsquo;m gonna forgive you! Because that&rsquo;s what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that <b>I</b> forgave you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can&rsquo;t remember that, I think we should write it down&mdash;let&rsquo;s write it down!</p>
