<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Joey, Monica, and Phoebe are there as Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!</p>
<p>(We see Joey who has puffed up his cheeks and Chandler nonchalantly reaches down and pinches Joey&rsquo;s nose shut. In a few seconds, Joey has to move because he&rsquo;s now forced to actually hold his breath.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) Dude! What are yo&mdash;you trying to kill me?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh, what?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well since I&rsquo;m movin&rsquo; out and-and you&rsquo;re so beautiful&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> &hellip;how about I move in with you?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Who&rsquo;s Denise?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> My roommate.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You have a roommate?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, Denise. Denise!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pheebs, I don&rsquo;t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! <b>DENISE!!!!!</b></p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin&rsquo; uh, I&rsquo;m gonna have an extra room over at my place&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, why don&rsquo;t you move in with me? It&rsquo;ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday&rsquo;s right?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, yeah I think I&rsquo;m gonna find my own place.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday&rsquo;s was just our thing man!</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross is reading a magazine, eating a cookie, and drinking some coffee as Phoebe enters.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You didn&rsquo;t tell her did you?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Of course not, because you&rsquo;re in love with her.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn&rsquo;t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What do you mean, comforted her?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s nothing, I just gave her a hug.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s also a sign of friendship.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of Ross&rsquo;s cookie.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ninety percent of a women&rsquo;s pheromones come out the top of her head! That&rsquo;s why, that&rsquo;s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you&rsquo;re a scientist.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I was hugging her as a friend. It&rsquo;s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she&rsquo;s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh&hellip;coconutty. (Phoebe raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel&rsquo;s not in the same place you are.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she <b>is</b> in the same place as me because <b>I</b> am not in that place!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I didn&rsquo;t understand that, but y&rsquo;know, maybe that&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause you were speaking the secret language of love!</p>
<p>(She goes for his magazine and he grabs it away before she reaches it. But she was only using the magazine as a decoy because she grabs his cookie and coffee, takes a bite out of the cookie and drinks some of the coffee.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Chandler and Monica are there as Joey enters.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Who was it?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know! How about, &ldquo;Thanks for taking the message.&rdquo; Jeez! (Exits.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay listen, y&rsquo;know when you move in Rachel&rsquo;s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven&rsquo;t thought about it that much.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y&rsquo;know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like <i>Space Invaders</i> and <i>Asteroids</i> for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay so you mean no as in, &ldquo;Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let&rsquo;s discuss it before we reject it completely.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, that&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I just don&rsquo;t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Which is why <i>Asteroids</i> is perfect! It&rsquo;s the oldest game!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What do you have against the beautiful guest room?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you mocking me?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I&rsquo;m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (Exits.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is coming from across the hall.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But you&rsquo;re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. (Shows him the paper.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (reading the ad) &ldquo;Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.&rdquo; Nice!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah? I just figured y&rsquo;know, after living with you it&rsquo;d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y&rsquo;know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who&rsquo;s different than me. And what&rsquo;s more different than me; a guy who&rsquo;s <b>not</b> 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.) Not just a hat rack my friend!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch staring off into space as Rachel enters.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, I have to ask you&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Shhhhhh! I&rsquo;m swamped right now.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You&rsquo;re just staring into space.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, I&rsquo;m trying to move that pencil. (There&rsquo;s a pencil lying on the table.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> This one? (Picks it up.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It worked!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and starts to read it.) &ldquo;Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s just, there is nothing! The city&rsquo;s full!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) &ldquo;Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay&hellip;&rdquo; Oh, yeah, but it&rsquo;s on the ground floor.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Why?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, there&rsquo;s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he&rsquo;s going on a dig for like two years and he&rsquo;s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That sounds great! I&rsquo;d love to live at Warren&rsquo;s!! I love Warren! Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Don&rsquo;t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. (Rachel just looks at him.) Here&rsquo;s Warren&rsquo;s number.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank you!</p>
<p>(She hugs him and he starts to hug her back but notices the look Phoebe is giving him and pushes her away.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, you go grab it!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I saw it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, I&rsquo;m talking about that which you already know but won&rsquo;t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I do not re-love her.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you won&rsquo;t just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just promise me that you won&rsquo;t do anything stupid.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, we&rsquo;re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I&rsquo;m never gonna find anything.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You can live with me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, continued from earlier.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! Are you serious?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I would love to live with you Ross; that&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s great! Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m just glad I could, y&rsquo;know, help you out.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so, not stupid.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You&rsquo;re my hero!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hero, I uh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;well, all right.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses him on the cheek and exits.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You&rsquo;re gonna say things now, aren&rsquo;t ya?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. No, I won&rsquo;t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn&rsquo;t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that&rsquo;s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay, that&rsquo;s a lie.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica is in the kitchen as Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi, listen, I&rsquo;m sorry about before. I don&rsquo;t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn&rsquo;t get girls, and now I <b>can</b> &lsquo;em&mdash;Now, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) I&rsquo;m sorry too.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! Oh yes!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ohh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Listen, we don&rsquo;t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s a great idea! We can <b>easily</b> think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Totally!</p>
<p>(They start thinking.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We don&rsquo;t have to come up with this now.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh good.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, y&rsquo;know what? Why don&rsquo;t we think about changes we can make in the living room?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Changes?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I mean we&rsquo;re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You&rsquo;re-you&rsquo;re-you&rsquo;re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is that a problem?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, it&rsquo;s a set and they should probably stay together.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that&rsquo;s cool. Then I&rsquo;ll just bring them both over.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> See now-now you&rsquo;re taking them away from their home.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I&rsquo;ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah-yeah, y&rsquo;know what? Yeah, that&rsquo;s it-that&rsquo;s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I&rsquo;m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn&rsquo;t match! Where is it gonna go?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> In the game room!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look it is <b>not</b> my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right! That&rsquo;s fine! That&rsquo;s fine! I won&rsquo;t bring over the chairs! I won&rsquo;t bring anything over! I wouldn&rsquo;t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma&rsquo;s place!! (Storms out.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is interviewing a potential roommate. And yes, she&rsquo;s a female, non-smoker and very non-ugly.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (exiting from Chandler&rsquo;s room with the new roommate) Everything on your application looks really good&mdash;Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?</p>
<p><b>The Potential Roommate:</b> Oh don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not really a party girl.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa!! Now look, don&rsquo;t be just blurtin&rsquo; stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential roommate) Hi! I&rsquo;ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh don&rsquo;t listen to him, he&rsquo;s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gonna get it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why did you take the shower curtain down?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) I&rsquo;m very safety conscious.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross&rsquo;s Apartment, Rachel is entering and Ross is making some room on the shelves for his stuff.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica&rsquo;s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they&rsquo;re not moving in.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What do you mean, they&rsquo;re not moving in? They-they&rsquo;re still moving in right?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! Over a stupid room!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I&rsquo;m also really psyched &lsquo;cause I don&rsquo;t have to move in here!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no, yeah no, that part&rsquo;s great!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Ross is entering, dragging Chandler, to mediate the argument between Chandler and Monica.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What&rsquo;s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, we can handle this.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, apparently not, and I can&rsquo;t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, why don&rsquo;t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks him and he joins in.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I&rsquo;ve known you both a long time, and I&rsquo;ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you&rsquo;ve been since you&rsquo;ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Love is the best medicine.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s laughter.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why do you do it?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I do.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don&rsquo;t ya?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! (Storms out.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel is sitting at the counter waiting for Gunther, yep Gunther&rsquo;s back, to refill her coffee.</h3>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> So I understand you&rsquo;re looking for a place.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no, I&rsquo;m staying put.</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why, where are you going?</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey Rach!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That&rsquo;s great news right&mdash;I mean for them. Right?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wow.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Y&rsquo;know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s gonna be weird?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, because of us! Because of our history.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Not at all!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Good! Me neither! So it&rsquo;s not a problem. We&rsquo;re just two friends who happen to be roommates.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?! We are?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! I&rsquo;m gonna have a boyfriend, you&rsquo;re gonna have a girlfriend&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh! That would be great.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> But y&rsquo;know what, if you think it&rsquo;s gonna be okay we&rsquo;ll just work out a system. Y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;ll be like college, I&rsquo;ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, &ldquo;Come back later, I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; lucky.&rdquo; (Laughs.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t think of that.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Chandler is once again being dragged in by Ross so he that he can try to manipulate the situation so that it&rsquo;s best for Ross, not necessarily what&rsquo;s best for Monica and Chandler.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it&rsquo;s a <b>really</b> big step! And-and what&rsquo;s the rush?!</p>
<p>(They both start laughing at him.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s very funny!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> He&rsquo;s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I-I-I&rsquo;m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y&rsquo;know you break up!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn&rsquo;t about the room, this is about what the room&hellip;represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel&rsquo;s room) could destroy you!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;m not so worried.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, no, me neither.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine! It&rsquo;s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.) I just don&rsquo;t want to see you guys break up! Which you <b>will</b> do if you move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that&rsquo;s what you want, there&rsquo;s nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) <b>DON&rsquo;T DO IT</b>!!!!! (Finally leaves.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You still want to move in together right?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Of course!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross didn&rsquo;t scare you?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Come here, I want to show you something!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>
<p>(They run to the living room where Monica has moved the chair back (Towards the step), the coffee table forward (Towards the TV), and taped a square outline on the floor.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God! Someone&rsquo;s killed Square Man!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it&rsquo;s still walking distance to the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh that&rsquo;s so sweet! I want to show you something too!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know those big-big uh, road signs that say &ldquo;Merge?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh-hmm.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that&rsquo;s you and I together! Merge!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! I love that!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, no!!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Phoebe is singing a new song. Yep, the first new Phoebe song of season six, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are also there.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) <i>I found you in my bed! <br>
 How&rsquo;d you whined up there? <br>
 You are a mystery!<br>
 Little black curly hair!<br>
 Little black curly hair!<br>
 Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</i></p>
<p>(Applause.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, well let&rsquo;s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Fighting?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, the other thing. I really think it&rsquo;s great they work things out.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. There&rsquo;s no breaking them up, is there?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there&rsquo;s no turning back.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind. (She exits)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;ve been back and forth.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you&rsquo;re right where you don&rsquo;t want to be! Back together!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ehh, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think so. She&rsquo;s already talked about y&rsquo;know, dating other guys.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s not gonna work out! Then she&rsquo;s gonna come home all weepy and you&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo; her, &ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s okay. You&rsquo;ll find someone.&rdquo; And then, <b>bamn</b>! She finds you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well, m-maybe you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Is that what I want?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on the microphone, accidentally) Yes.</p>
<p>(Rachel enters.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Here she comes. Hold on, I&rsquo;m gonna make your life much easier.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, well the place was closed. I&rsquo;ll just copy it later.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Or not. Uh, Rach, why don&rsquo;t you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no&hellip; It&rsquo;s okay, I mean I&mdash;look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday&rsquo;s thing, but we don&rsquo;t have to do that!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you&rsquo;re thinking about Naked Wednesday&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thursday&rsquo;s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!</p>
