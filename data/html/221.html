<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Everyone is there. Monica is watching stock prices on a business channel.]</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Monica, why are we watchin&rsquo; the business channel?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &rsquo;Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it&rsquo;s pretty exciting.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok honey, you really need a job.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, right there. That, that&rsquo;s the third sign today. Right there.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> On behalf of everyone, I&rsquo;d just like to say behuh.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, &rsquo;cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet&hellip;which is my father&rsquo;s last name.</p>
<p><b>Everyone:</b> Ahh.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> His indian name?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Freakish.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Freaky.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Weird, weird.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, alright, that&rsquo;s it, now I have to go see him.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hamburger. McDonald&rsquo;s. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Do you say this stuff to girls?</p>
<p><b>Big Bully:</b> Hehehehey, isn&rsquo;t that the guy who used to wear your hat?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Back in the cab in front of Phoebe&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s house.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Phoeb&rsquo;s, I think you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It&rsquo;s just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let&rsquo;s face it, she&rsquo;s not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I&rsquo;ve barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don&rsquo;t know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, thanks. Sorry, again</p>
<p>[She starts the cab and pulls forward. We hear a squish and a dog yelp.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> [innocently] What was that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, I&rsquo;m guessing the threshold&rsquo;s clear now.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Joey is eating breakfast, Rachel has just gotten up, and Monica is on the phone.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C&rsquo;mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Time is money my friend?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you missed, &lsquo;Takes money to make money,&rsquo; and uh, &rsquo;don&rsquo;t make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> How did you make $17.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> How come those?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What happened to uh, MEG.?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That is so not my motto.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> [enters] Hey.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how&rsquo;s the dog?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella&rsquo;s gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Good.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, thank God.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog&rsquo;s ear grow back so&hellip;still hoping.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I, I don&rsquo;t wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like &lsquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Phoebs, if you want, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok. Listen, just don&rsquo;t say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone that&rsquo;s sitting by Monica]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> <b>DOn&rsquo;t</b>&hellip;be too long with the phone.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> She&rsquo;ll be a much better friend when the market closes.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> [dials the phone] It&rsquo;s a woman.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So talk to her.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> [in a fake voice] Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he&rsquo;ll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. [hangs up]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why the voice.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> [in the voice] Hard to say.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s apartment. Ross is sitting at the bar, Chandler serves up two mugs of hot water.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Your cappucino sir.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p>[they both pour in packets of cappucino mix]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Absolutely.</p>
<p>[they both stir thier coffee and proceed to stare into the mugs]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> How come it&rsquo;s not mixing with the water?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b>Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.</p>
<p>[they both try to drink while continuously stirring]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> [walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I&rsquo;ll tell you what. After I get back from my neice&rsquo;s christening, I&rsquo;ll go down to the coffee house with you and we&rsquo;ll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No. Man I don&rsquo;t wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don&rsquo;t wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a &lsquo;K&rsquo;. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, hang on a second there Custer.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> By someone besides Monica?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that&rsquo;s just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, couldn&rsquo;t we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine&rsquo;s growing back.</p>

One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom&rsquo;s purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there&rsquo;s my dad&rsquo;s head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving &rsquo;cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, that&rsquo;d be ok.</p>
<p><b>Frank:</b> Alright.</p>
