<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, everyone is there.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he&rsquo;s got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, you don&rsquo;t wanna mess with corn nuts. They&rsquo;re craaazy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There&rsquo;s some creep out there with a telescope!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe it! He&rsquo;s looking right at us!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, that is so sick.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I feel violated. And not in a good way.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How can people do that?&hellip; (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn&rsquo;t have to play any games&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So have you called her yet?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It&rsquo;s the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I&rsquo;m right, right?</p>
<p><b>Joey and Ross:</b> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Her answer machine?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, uh, why didn&rsquo;t you say anything?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase &ldquo;Yes indeedy-o.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look look! It&rsquo;s Rachel and Barry. No, don&rsquo;t everybody look at once!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, they&rsquo;re just talking&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, no actually, he&rsquo;s smiling.. and&hellip; Oh my God, don&rsquo;t do that!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What? What?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (bluffing) And basically, that&rsquo;s how a bill becomes a law.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh!&hellip; Right!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey Rach!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How&rsquo;d it go?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&rsquo;know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the <em>Russian Tea Room</em>, and I had that chicken, where y&rsquo;know you poke it and all the butter squirts out&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not a good day for birds&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Then we took a walk down to <em>Bendall&rsquo;s</em>, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of <em>Chanel</em>&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s nice&hellip; now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that&hellip; Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y&rsquo;know? It was comfortable, it was familiar&hellip; it was just nice!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s nice twice!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, what&rsquo;s going on? I mean isn&rsquo;t this the same Barry who you left at the altar?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Duh, where&rsquo;ve you been?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn&rsquo;t, like, Orthodontist Guy, y&rsquo;know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?</p>
<p>(Ross &lsquo;prompts&rsquo; Chandler by hitting him on the arm.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I have my reasons.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, how about the fact that he&rsquo;s engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it&rsquo;s stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Barry&rsquo;s Office, the post-coital Barry and Rachel are recovering on the chair.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow&hellip; Wow!</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> Nooo, it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, and it&rsquo;s so nice having this little sink here&hellip;</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, everyone is there except Rachel.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn&rsquo;t expecting the machine&hellip; Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> <b>That&rsquo;s</b> what you&rsquo;ve been working on for the past two hours?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, I&rsquo;ve been honing!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What was with the dishes?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y&rsquo;know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven&rsquo;t been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (looking out the window) Look look! He&rsquo;s doing it again, the guy with the telescope!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Great, now he&rsquo;s waving back.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can&rsquo;t do stuff!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What kinda stuff?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Will you grow up? I&rsquo;m not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I&rsquo;m cooking naked.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You cook naked?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, toast, oatmeal&hellip; nothing that spatters.</p>
<p>(A pause as they look at Chandler.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you looking at me for? I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Barry&rsquo;s Office, Rachel and Barry are getting married.</h3>
<p><b>Barry:</b> What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; Oh, Barry, this was not good.</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> No, it was. It was very very good.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what about Mindy?</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> Oh, way, way better than Mindy.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> Well, if you want, I&rsquo;ll just&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just break it off with her.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don&rsquo;t do that. Not, I mean not for me.</p>
<p><b>Bernice:</b> (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let&rsquo;s go away this weekend.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh&hellip; it was really nice. You would&rsquo;ve liked it.</p>
<p>(Pause as Rachel realises&hellip;)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I had a bra.</p>
<p>(Barry finds it draped on a cupboard and gives it to Rachel, they kiss as Bobby enters.)</p>
<p><b>Bobby:</b> Hey, Dr. Farber.</p>
<p>(Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachel&rsquo;s mouth.)</p>
<p><b>Barry:</b> All right Miss Green, everything looks fine&hellip; Yep, I think we&rsquo;re starting to see some real progress here.</p>
<p>(Bobby looks on, deadpan.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Bobby:</b> I&rsquo;m twelve, I&rsquo;m not stupid.</p>
<p>(Rachel glares at him.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Chandler enters clutching his phone.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can I use your phone?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.</p>
<p>(Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, it&rsquo;s working! Why isn&rsquo;t she calling me back?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe she never got your message.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn&rsquo;t get her messages yet.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;don&rsquo;t think that makes me seem a little&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &hellip;desperate, needy, pathetic?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.</p>
<p>(He calls and quickly hangs up.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How many beeps?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> She answered.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;see, this is where you&rsquo;d use that &lsquo;hello&rsquo; word we talked about.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I&rsquo;m needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.</p>
<p>(Rachel enters.)</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hey! Hi!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How&rsquo;d he take it?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pretty well, actually&hellip; (Wandering into the kitchen.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach&hellip; how come you have dental floss in your hair?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, do I?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh huh.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You had <b>sex</b> in his <b>chair</b>?!&hellip; I said that a little too loudly, didn&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You-you had what?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sex in his chair.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What, uh&hellip; what were you thinking?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t know! I mean, we still care about each other. There&rsquo;s a history there. &rsquo;s&rsquo;like you and Carol.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Please. If she said to you, &ldquo;Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,&rdquo; what would you say?</p>
<p>(Ross flounders.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> If it helps, I could slide over.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, uh, a totally diferent situation! It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s apples and oranges, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Where are you going?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?</p>
<p>(Ross exits, a phone rings, and Chandler dives for his phone.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello? Hello?</p>
<p>(Rachel picks up their phone and the ringing stops. As she talks on the phone, an elaborate visual gag is spun out which is too difficult to describe in words.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ve heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay. Okay, well I&rsquo;m working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and&hellip; (Listens) Okay&hellip; (Listens) Great&hellip; (Listens) Great&hellip; (Listens) All right, so I&rsquo;ll, so I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay&hellip; (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So how&rsquo;s Mindy?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow&hellip;Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry&hellip; (Does so, on phone) Hi, it&rsquo;s me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;d be!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (intrigued) Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And now, y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;m like&hellip; I&rsquo;m like the other woman! I feel so..</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> ..Naughty!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, hold up, I&rsquo;ll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That&rsquo;s fine, yeah&hellip;</p>
<p>(Joey exits.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It&rsquo;s, uh, it&rsquo;s Chandler! (Listens) I&rsquo;m fine. Uh, listen, I don&rsquo;t know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that&rsquo;s fine, that&rsquo;s great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She&rsquo;s on the other line, she&rsquo;s gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.)

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mindy.</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> Hey, you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, you&hellip; So, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> Um.. we should really be sitting for this.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure we should&hellip; So.</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> Now, I know things&rsquo;ve been weird lately, but you&rsquo;re like my oldest friend in the world&hellip; Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don&rsquo;t talk to anywhere, &rsquo;cause she&rsquo;s all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn&rsquo;t have a pretty face. &hellip;Okay, I&rsquo;m just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> Will you be my maid of honour?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Of course!</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> Oh that&rsquo;s so great!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Was that all you wanted to ask me?</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> That&rsquo;s all!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) &hellip;What? What?</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> That&rsquo;s not all.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh sure it is!</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> Oh no, it isn&rsquo;t! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, what- what would make you think that?</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he&rsquo;s been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like <em>Chanel</em>.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it&rsquo;ll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> Oh God! You see, that&rsquo;s what I was afraid of!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? What&rsquo;s what you were afraid of?</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> Okay, okay&hellip; when Barry was engaged to you, he and I&hellip;kind of&hellip; had a little thing on the side.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, he&rsquo;s just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel,&rdquo; and now I feel so stupid.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh&hellip; Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?</p>
<p><b>Mindy:</b> Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I am so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) &hellip; Just pointing out the irony.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper&rsquo;s name! Can I use the phone?</p>

(Listens) If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn&rsquo;t have to feel like&mdash;(Listens)&mdash;Thank you, but&hellip; that&rsquo;s not really the point&hellip; (Listens) The point is that&hellip; (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally..</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey!!</p>

<p><b>Mindy:</b> Yeah&hellip; I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m still gonna marry him.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He&rsquo;s Satan in a smock!</p>

<p><b>Danielle:</b> Well, I&rsquo;ve been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I&rsquo;d just come down here, and make sure you were okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m okay.</p>
<p><b>Danielle:</b> Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That sounds good. I&rsquo;ll call you- or you call me, whatever&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Danielle:</b> You got it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Danielle:</b> G&rsquo;bye, everybody.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Bye.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, there you go!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Second date!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;I dunno.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You <b>don&rsquo;t know</b>?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,&hellip; how needy is that?</p>
<p>(They all groan and hit him..)</p>
