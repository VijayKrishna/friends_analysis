<p><b>Rachel:</b> (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there&rsquo;s Joey&rsquo;s picture! This is so exciting!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can always spot someone who&rsquo;s never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s not just <i>Freud</i>, it&rsquo;s <i>Freud!</i></p>
<p>(The lights dim.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.</p>
<p>(The lights go up on the stage, Joey, as Freud, is talking to a female patient.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Vell, Eva, ve&rsquo;ve done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>All you want is a dingle,<br>
 What you envy&rsquo;s a schwang,<br>
 A thing through which you can tinkle,<br>
 Or play with, or simply let hang&hellip;</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Theater, the play has ended and everyone is applauding. As soon as the cast leaves, the gang all groan and sit down heavily.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> God. I feel violated.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Is it? Feels like two.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, <b>ten o&rsquo;clock</b>.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sighs and gestures to explain) There&rsquo;s a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o&rsquo;clock!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. Hel-lo!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> She&rsquo;s amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, go over to her! She&rsquo;s not with anyone.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? &ldquo;Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, c&rsquo;mon. She&rsquo;s a person, you can do it!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh please, could she <b>be</b> more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He could never get a woman like that in a million years.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you, buddy.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, oh, but y&rsquo;know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You could do that!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;think?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh God, I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m even considering this&hellip; I&rsquo;m very very aware of my tongue&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> C&rsquo;mon! C&rsquo;mon!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> &hellip;Yes?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi&hellip; um&hellip; okay, next word&hellip; would be&hellip; Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh&hellip;(He clears his throat noisily)&hellip;hi.</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> Yes, you said that.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, yes I did, but what I didn&rsquo;t say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh&hellip; would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> Chandler?</p>
<p>(Joey enters from behind a curtain. The others all talk at once.)</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hey! You&rsquo;re in a play! I didn&rsquo;t know you could dance! You had a beard!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Whadja think?</p>
<p>(Pause)</p>
<p><b>All:</b> &hellip;Hey! You&rsquo;re in a play! I didn&rsquo;t know you could dance! You had a beard!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> C&rsquo;mon, you guys, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> (admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name&rsquo;s Aurora, and she&rsquo;s Italian, and she pronounces my name &lsquo;Chand-lrr&rsquo;. &lsquo;Chand-lrr&rsquo;. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What is it?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Based on <i>this play</i>? &hellip;Based on this play!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, everyone else is there as Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, kids.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (reading Monica&rsquo;s palm) No, &rsquo;cause this line is passion, and this is&hellip; just a line.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve been here almost seven seconds and you haven&rsquo;t asked me how my date went.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, right, right. How was your date, &lsquo;Chand-lrr&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It was unbelievable. I-I&rsquo;ve never met anyone like her. She&rsquo;s had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army&hellip;</p>
<p>(A flashback of Aurora and Chandler on their date in Central Perk is denoted by <i>italics</i>.)</p>
<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> &hellip;Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- &hellip;I&rsquo;ve been talking about myself all night long, I&rsquo;m sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn&hellip; just for the hell of it.</i></p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We talked &rsquo;til like two. It was this perfect evening&hellip; more or less.</p>
<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> &hellip;All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, so &lsquo;we&rsquo; is?</i></p>
<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> &lsquo;We&rsquo; would be me and Rick.</i></p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Who&rsquo;s Rick?</p>
<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> Who&rsquo;s Rick?</i></p>
<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> My husband.</i></p>
<p><b>All:</b> Ooooohhh.</p>
<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, so you&rsquo;re divorced?</i></p>
<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> No.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, then you&rsquo;re widowed?&hellip;Hopefully?</i></p>
<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> No, I&rsquo;m still married.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?&hellip;Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?</i></p>
<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> Don&rsquo;t worry. I imagine he&rsquo;d be okay with you because really, he&rsquo;s okay with Ethan.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> Ethan? There&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s an Ethan?</i></p>
<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> Mmmm&hellip; Ethan is my&hellip; boyfriend.</i></p>
<p><b>All:</b> What?!</p>
<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?</i></p>
<p><i><b>Aurora:</b> I suppose mainly sexual.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;Hm.</i></p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. I&rsquo;m sorry it didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What &lsquo;not work out&rsquo;? I&rsquo;m seeing her again on Thursday. Didn&rsquo;t you listen to the story?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Didn&rsquo;t you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, y&rsquo;know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and <b>none</b> of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy&rsquo;s fantasy!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, of course not! (Thinks) &hellip;Yeah, yeah, it is.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What? So you guys don&rsquo;t mind going out with someone else who&rsquo;s going out with someone else?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Good for you, Joey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> When I&rsquo;m with a woman, I need to <em>know</em> that I&rsquo;m going out with more people than she is.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, y&rsquo;know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-</p>
<p>(They all pretend to fall asleep.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine. Fine, alright, now you&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We&rsquo;re kidding. C&rsquo;mon, tell us!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! C&rsquo;mon!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright. There&rsquo;s a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-</p>
<p>(They all fall asleep again.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is there as enter except Joey enter.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Tah-daaah!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are we greeting each other this way now? &rsquo;Cause I like that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors&hellip; I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s for.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we&rsquo;re not supposed to ask.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, whaddya think?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &hellip;Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Uh-oh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How-how did that happen?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it&rsquo;s an extra seat around the coffee table.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.. but y&rsquo;know what? Just for fun, let&rsquo;s see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let&rsquo;s see. Well, it looks good there too. Let&rsquo;s just leave it there for a while.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Rachel) I can&rsquo;t believe you tried to move the green ottoman.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank God you didn&rsquo;t try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she&rsquo;ll scratch your eyes right out.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You guys, I am not that bad!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y&rsquo;know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That is so unfair!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh c&rsquo;mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn&rsquo;t raggedy!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, so I&rsquo;m responsible, I&rsquo;m organised. But hey, I can be a kook.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don&rsquo;t pay it right away.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why not?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Because you&rsquo;re a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I could do that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it&rsquo;s not the one with the easy-pour spout.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why would someone do that?! &hellip;One might wonder.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Someone&rsquo;s left a glass on the coffee table. There&rsquo;s no coaster. It&rsquo;s a cold drink, it&rsquo;s a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> STOP IT!! &hellip;Oh my God. It&rsquo;s true! Who am I?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica? You&rsquo;re Mom.</p>
<p>(Monica gasps.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!</p>
<p>(Joey enters and he&rsquo;s on the phone.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh&hellip; oh my God! Okay! Okay, I&rsquo;ll be there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job&hellip;in the new Al Pacino movie!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh my God! Whoah!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, what&rsquo;s the part?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy&rsquo;s the reason I became an actor! &rdquo;I&rsquo;m out of order? Pfeeeh. You&rsquo;re out of order! This whole courtroom&rsquo;s out of order!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Seriously, what-what&rsquo;s the part?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &ldquo;Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> C&rsquo;mon, seriously, Joey, what&rsquo;s the part?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &hellip;I&rsquo;m his (mumbles)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> ..You&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re &lsquo;mah mah mah&rsquo; what?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &hellip;I&rsquo;m his butt double. &rsquo;kay? I play Al Pacino&rsquo;s butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I&rsquo;m his butt.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> C&rsquo;mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino&rsquo;s in it, and that&rsquo;s big!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no, it&rsquo;s terrific, it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s&hellip; y&rsquo;know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you&rsquo;ve finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don&rsquo;t care! This is a big break for me!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right, it is&hellip;So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, the next morning, Monica is getting the door.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, alright, alright&hellip;</p>
<p>(Joey enters with Monica&rsquo;s paper and hands it to her.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> For what?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Whaddya think? Today&rsquo;s the big day!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don&rsquo;t ever tell me what you did in there.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)</p>
<p>(Chandler enters with the phone.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Where&rsquo;s Joey? His mom&rsquo;s on the phone.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> He&rsquo;s in the bathroom. I don&rsquo;t think you wanna go in there!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> C&rsquo;mon, we&rsquo;re roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I warned you&hellip;</p>
<p>(Rachel enters from her room.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who is being loud?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, you got the whole night, huh?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y&rsquo;know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, no resentment, believe me, it&rsquo;s worth it. &rsquo;kay? Y&rsquo;know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you&rsquo;ll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I&rsquo;ve just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y&rsquo;know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush&hellip;But I&rsquo;m not gonna do that.</p>
<p>(She opens the door and he leaves.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Film Set, Joey is entering for his scene.</h3>
<p><b>Director:</b> (on phone)&hellip;Dammit, hire the girl! (He hangs up the phone.) Okay, everybody ready?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> Lose the robe.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Me?</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> That would work.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is lost.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> Okay, everybody, we&rsquo;d like to get this in one take, please. Let&rsquo;s roll it.. water&rsquo;s working (The shower starts).. and&hellip; action.</p>
<p>(Joey starts to the shower with a grim, determined look on his face.)</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m- I&rsquo;m showering.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> No, that was clenching.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy&rsquo;s upset here, y&rsquo;know? I mean, his wife&rsquo;s dead, his brother&rsquo;s missing&hellip; I think his butt would be angry here.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling&hellip; water working&hellip; and action&hellip;and cut. What was that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask&hellip;</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Aurora and Chandler are in bed in Chandler&rsquo;s room.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> God, I love these fingers&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at &rsquo;em, look at how happy they are.</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> (moves Chandler&rsquo;s arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I&rsquo;m late. (She starts to get up.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no nonononononnononono, don&rsquo;t go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Don&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> Okay. Oh no, I have to.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to himself) Too bad, she&rsquo;s leaving.</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> (getting up and dressing) I&rsquo;m sorry. He&rsquo;ll be waiting for me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> It&rsquo;s not Rick.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> No, it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s Andrew.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know there&rsquo;ll be many moments in the years to come when I&rsquo;ll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> He&rsquo;s&hellip; new.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, so what you&rsquo;re saying is you&rsquo;re not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> No, that&rsquo;s not exactly what I was..</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, y&rsquo;know, most women would kill for three guys like us.</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> So what do you want?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You.</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> You have me!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nono, just you.</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> Whaddyou mean?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Lose the other guys.</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> &hellip;Like, &hellip;all of them?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> C&rsquo;mon, we&rsquo;re great together, why not?</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> Why can&rsquo;t we just have what we have now? Why can&rsquo;t we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another&hellip; and up until tonight I thought that&rsquo;s what you wanted too.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;Well, y&rsquo;know, part of me wants that, but it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m two guys, y&rsquo;know? I mean, one guy&rsquo;s going &ldquo;Shut up! This is great!&rdquo; But there&rsquo;s this other guy. Actually it&rsquo;s the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch&rsquo;s heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device&hellip; And he&rsquo;s saying, y&rsquo;know, &ldquo;This is too hard! Get out! Get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> So&hellip; which one of the two guys will you listen to?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don&rsquo;t exactly let each other finish&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> Which one?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;The second guy.</p>
<p><b>Aurora:</b> (gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind.</p>
<p>(She kisses him, he holds her, and kisses her passionately.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.</p>
<p>(She leaves, Chandler sighs, and falls back on his bed.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Ross is trying to comfort Chandler. Joey is absent.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look at it this way: <b>you</b> dumped <b>her</b>. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable&hellip; Tell me why you did this again?</p>
<p>(Joey enters.)</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, waitwait, aren&rsquo;t you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Nope.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No? What happened, big guy?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) &lsquo;Big guy?&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It felt like a &lsquo;big guy&rsquo; moment.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I got fired.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody&rsquo;s gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> My mom will.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Something so sweet and&hellip;disturbing about that.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;ve done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Maybe this wasn&rsquo;t your shot.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I mean&hellip; I think when it&rsquo;s your shot, y&rsquo;know, you-you know it&rsquo;s your shot. Did it&hellip; feel like your shot..?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hard to tell, I was naked.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I don&rsquo;t think this was your shot. I mean, I don&rsquo;t even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You&rsquo;ve gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go &ldquo;I got the part! I got the part! I&rsquo;m gonna be Joey Tribbiani&rsquo;s ass!&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah? That&rsquo;s so nice! (They hug.)</p>
<p>(Ross and Chandler look at each other and hug as well.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, Joey. I&rsquo;m gonna go to bed, guys.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Night.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (determined) Uh-huh!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Doesn&rsquo;t matter, I&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her room.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She <b>is</b> a kook.</p>

<h2>Closing Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica&rsquo;s Bedroom, she&rsquo;s lying in bed wide awake.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) <em>If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don&rsquo;t do this. This is stupid! I don&rsquo;t have to prove anything, I&rsquo;m gonna go get them&hellip;But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! &hellip;I need help! </em>(She buries her head in her pillow.)</p>
