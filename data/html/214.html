<p>[Monica enters from bathroom after taking a shower]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, you feelin&rsquo; better?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, do you have any other possibilities?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh yeah, well there&rsquo;s the possibility that I won&rsquo;t make rent.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No no no, if I couldn&rsquo;t pay you back right away then I&rsquo;d feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh OK. Well then why don&rsquo;t you, uhh, why don&rsquo;t you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ya know, the man&rsquo;s got a point. [gestures with his arm and the bracelet falls off]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What is that sparkly thing?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That thing, it&rsquo;s a uhh&hellip; yeah it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a little flashy.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Hi darling.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So, what&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Some of your old stuff.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We&rsquo;re turning your room into a gym.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross&rsquo;s room?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn&rsquo;t want to disturb them.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, God forbid.</p>
<p>[Rachel enters with a laundry basket]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, well, you know, they&rsquo;re just separated so, you know, never know, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Well, I can&rsquo;t say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we&rsquo;ve known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What, what incident?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don&rsquo;t you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold. [shuffles her into her room]</p>

That was really good, I think I&rsquo;m ready for my penis now.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> [walks over to the woman] I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Gail:</b> I&rsquo;m Gail.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Chandler. [waves his arm around, exposing the bracelet]</p>
<p><b>Gail:</b> I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What? [realizes it was the bracelet] Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don&rsquo;t have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Chandler, Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that&hellip; [turns around and sees Joey] Hi.

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think she&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> [Rachel, laughing, puts a hand on the guy&rsquo;s shoulder] Look at that, look at that, see how she&rsquo;s pushing him away and he won&rsquo;t budge. Alright, I&rsquo;m gonna do something. [walks up in the middle of their conversation] Excuse me, are you Rachel?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m Ross Geller. Wha, I&rsquo;m, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you, what are you doin&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don&rsquo;t believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll have something to tell the grandkids.</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> Sure will. I&rsquo;ve uh, gotta go. Take care.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, but, but&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, doesn&rsquo;t the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK, well that&rsquo;s the part where I&rsquo;m a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn&rsquo;t focus on that. [Joey goes to his room and shuts the door] Hey, c&rsquo;mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my&hellip; [notices the bracelet is missing from his wrist] wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. [he starts searching the room, lifting up the couch cushions]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You know what the&hellip; [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now&hellip; [Joey returns to his room]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Where have you been?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, but that&rsquo;s probably &rsquo;cause I haven&rsquo;t asked them yet.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> C&rsquo;mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t tell you this before but umm, I, I&rsquo;m no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk. Chandler and Phoebe enter.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, you&rsquo;re right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. [sits down at the bar]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> [comes up from behind the bar and startles Chandler] Hey. I&rsquo;ve got something that&rsquo;s gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? [holds up Chandler&rsquo;s bracelet]</p>
