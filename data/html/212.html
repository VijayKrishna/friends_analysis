<p>{Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: This is an hour-long special episode. Which means that the first part of this episode is episode 212. The second part of this episode is episode 213. Since episodes 212 and 213 are combined into one file, that&rsquo;s why there is no episode 213 in the season 2 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 212 to 214.}</p>
<p><b>[Scene: In a TV commercial that the gang is watching at Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s.]</b></p>
<p><i>[A guy is sitting at his desk and his boss comes in and drops a huge pile of papers on his desk. The guy looks dejected.]</i></p>
<p><i><b>Commercial Voiceover:</b> Can&rsquo;t get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth&hellip;</i></p>
<p><i>[A monkey jumps on the desk and hands the guy a beer. He opens the beer and is suddenly on the beach, in a hammock, with beautiful women all around.]</i></p>
<p><i><b>Commercial Voiceover:</b> &hellip;With MonkeyShine Beer. [MonkeyShine theme] MonkeyShine Beer, &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s a jungle out there.]</i></p>
<p>[Camera pans back from the TV to show the gang watching.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That commercial always makes me so sad.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can see that, &rsquo;cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.<br> Monica: And the fact that they&rsquo;re both monkeys.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Remember when sometimes he&rsquo;d borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there&rsquo;d be little monkey raisins in it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss&rsquo;s hat&hellip; all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah, the stalker.</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Never mind, it&rsquo;s open.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> [Joey grabs a frying pan] Yes, hitting her with a frying pan&rsquo;s a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn&rsquo;t a cartoon.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Let&rsquo;s get out of here.</p>
<p>[They run out and knock on Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s door]</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> San Diego Zoo. Ross is at the Monkey cages.</h3>
<p><b>Lipson:</b> Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I uh, I can&rsquo;t seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He&rsquo;s a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.</p>
<p><b>Lipson:</b> Ahh, I&rsquo;m afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God, what happened?</p>
<p><b>Lipson:</b> Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe this.</p>
<p><b>Lipson:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there&rsquo;s an old saying, &rsquo;sometimes monkeys die.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, ya know, someone should have called me.</p>
<p><b>Lipson:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry. Look, I know this can&rsquo;t bring him back but here, it&rsquo;s just a gesture.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Zoo dollars?</p>
<p><b>Lipson:</b> Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it&rsquo;s a lot cuter if your monkey hasn&rsquo;t just died.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Library. Phoebe is getting ready to sing for the kids. Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there.</h3>
<p>[Phoebe pulls out her guitar]</p>
<p><b>Kids:</b> Ooohhh.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe Joey&rsquo;s having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you remember Cathy Bates in <i>Misery</i>?</p>
<p><b>Rachel AND Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And she&rsquo;s not crazy?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no no no, she&rsquo;s a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ah, and I mean, he&rsquo;s going out with her? He can not persue this.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What&rsquo;re you lookin&rsquo; at me for? He&rsquo;s the one who wants to boff the maniac.</p>
<p><b>Rob:</b> You OK?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, uh-uh, I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.</p>
<p><b>Rob:</b> That&rsquo;s not a good idea, that&rsquo;s kinda the reason the last guy got fired.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I was thinkin&rsquo; about it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK. [they kiss] OK, alrighty, let&rsquo;s play some tunes. Hi everybody, I&rsquo;m Phoebe</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hi Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, um, I&rsquo;m gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. [singing]<br>
<i>Now, grandma&rsquo;s a person who everyone likes,<br> she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike.<br> But lately she hasn&rsquo;t been coming to dinner,<br> And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner.<br> Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru,<br> but the truth is she died and some day you will too.<br> La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la&hellip;</i></p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A nice restraunt. Joey and Erica are dining.</h3>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Oh, Drake, isn&rsquo;t it amazing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah it is&hellip; what?</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone&rsquo;s spinal cord.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Who&rsquo;s they?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No one.</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them&hellip; but I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright, just one. [she licks his hands rather emphatically] Wow, you&rsquo;re good at that.</p>
<p>[Some guy at another table starts choking]</p>
<p><b>Waiter:</b> Oh my God! Someone, he&rsquo;s choking. Is anyone here a doctor?</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> San Diege Zoo. Ross is still at the monkey cages. A janitor is sweeping.</h3>
<p><b>Janitor:</b> Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, hey look, I don&rsquo;t really enjoy being with other men <i>that</i> way. But, um, zoo dollars?</p>
<p><b>Janitor:</b> It&rsquo;s about your monkey. It&rsquo;s alive.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Restraunt. Joey and Erica are still there.</h3>
<p><b>Erica:</b> I don&rsquo;t understand, why didn&rsquo;t you help that man?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, cause, uhh, I&rsquo;m a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> No, no no no, you don&rsquo;t have to tell me anything. You don&rsquo;t have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But that&rsquo;s what&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> I should just be happy to be near you.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey I- [she cuts him off with a kiss]</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Hey what?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! [she starts nibbling his hand] Hey. He-hey.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Library. Phoebe is singing.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> [singing] <i>There&rsquo;ll be times when you get older<br> when you&rsquo;ll want to sleep with people<br> just to make them like you&hellip;<br> But don&rsquo;t.<br> Cause that&rsquo;s another thing that you don&rsquo;t wanna do, everybody<br> That&rsquo;s another thing that you don&rsquo;t wanna do.</i></p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Excellent!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Very informative!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Not at all inappropriate!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you for coming everybody. There&rsquo;re cookies in the back.</p>
<p><b>Rob:</b> That was great, the kids loved you.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yay, I rock.</p>
<p><b>Rob:</b> And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But.</p>
<p><b>Rob:</b> How did you know there was a but?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I sense these things. It was either but or butter.</p>
<p><b>Rob:</b> The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin&rsquo; that you&rsquo;d play more songs about like, barnyard animals.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can do that.</p>
<p><b>Rob:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rob:</b> Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thinkin&rsquo; about it.</p>

<p><b>Janitor:</b> Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.</p>
<p><b>Janitor:</b> The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That, that&rsquo;s the only thing the zoo&rsquo;s ever told me.</p>
<p><b>Janitor:</b> Of course they&rsquo;re gonna say he&rsquo;s dead. They don&rsquo;t want the bad publicity. It&rsquo;s all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That guy Lipson?</p>
<p><b>Janitor:</b> Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I, I only know Lipson.</p>
<p><b>Janitor:</b> Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.</p>
<p><b>Janitor:</b> Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Of course.</p>
<p><b>Janitor:</b> Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That&rsquo;s all I know.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> This is unbelievable.</p>
<p><b>Janitor:</b> So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you trying to get me to bribe you?</p>
<p><b>Janitor:</b> Maybe.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> But you already told me everything.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, so what&rsquo;re you gonna do?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I guess I&rsquo;m gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, hi again.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hi Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Today we&rsquo;re gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.</p>
<p>[singing] <i>Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo,<br> Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo.<br> Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up,<br> And that&rsquo;s how we get hamburgers.<br> Nooowww, chickens!</i></p>

<p>[knock at the door]</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> It&rsquo;s Erica.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, it&rsquo;s a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Erica, c&rsquo;mon in.</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Ohh, and I see you&rsquo;re having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Who?</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor&rsquo;s lounge.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s not what you think, that was&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> You told me I was the only one. [throws a glass of water in his face]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright look, that&rsquo;s it. I don&rsquo;t think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I&rsquo;m not even a doctor, I&rsquo;m an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> &rsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s a television show.</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Drake, what&rsquo;re you getting at?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m not Drake.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s right, he&rsquo;s not Drake, he&rsquo;s Hans Remore, Drake&rsquo;s evil twin.</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Is this true?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. [throws water in his face]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn&rsquo;t. [throws water in his face]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. [throws water in his face]</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Is all this true?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he&rsquo;s the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he&rsquo;s the guy for you.</p>
<p><b>Erica:</b> Oh Hans. [They kiss]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hans&hellip;Hans&hellip;Yo evil twin.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care</p>

<p><b>Susie:</b> I can&rsquo;t do Chris&rsquo;s makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.</p>
<p><b>Director&rsquo;s Assistant:</b> Is it bad?</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.</p>
<p><b>Director&rsquo;s Assistant:</b> I&rsquo;ll talk to her.</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> I hate actors.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> [to an extra in fatigues] Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn&rsquo;t see ya.</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> Excuse me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahhhh.</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> Uh, is your name Chandler?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, yes, yes it is.</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> Chandler Bing?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> I&rsquo;m Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look&hellip; great job growing up.</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> It&rsquo;s nice to see you&rsquo;re not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn&rsquo;t a pimp.</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don&rsquo;t do that anymore.</p>
<p>[cut to Monica and Rachel walking through the set]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What what what what?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn&rsquo;t know he was in this movie, he is so hot.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ya think?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see <i>Time Cop</i>?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, was he any good in it?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel, he like, totally changed time.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow, so why don&rsquo;t you go talk to him?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he&rsquo;s cute, what&rsquo;s the worst that could happen?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> He could hear me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> OK, I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; it for ya.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh Rachel don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t you dare, don&rsquo;t, <b>don&rsquo;t</b>. Tell him I cook.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Excuse me. Hi.</p>
<p><b>Van Damme:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you&rsquo;re cute.</p>
<p><b>Van Damme:</b> You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m cute?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I, I don&rsquo;t know, um, do you think you&rsquo;re cute? OK, we&rsquo;re kinda gettin&rsquo; off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you&rsquo;re cute. So what should I tell her?</p>
<p><b>Van Damme:</b> You can tell her I think her friend is cute.</p>
<p>[back to Chandler and Susie]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK that&rsquo;s not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.</p>
<p>[a voice in the background calls for makeup]</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> Oh that&rsquo;s me, I gotta go.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh uh, o, OK.</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, uh, let&rsquo;s try one more&hellip; there you go, say Ernie&rsquo;s, 8 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p><b>Susie:</b> I&rsquo;ll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I&rsquo;ll get to see your underwear.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No one was around to hear that?</p>
<p>[back to Rachel and Monica]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So what&rsquo;d he say?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, thanks anyway.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that&rsquo;s what you want to do&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Jean-Claude she said yes, I&rsquo;ll see you tonight. Thank you.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk. Joey and the girls are sitting at the couches.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that&rsquo;s where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh man, she&rsquo;s so smokin, she has got the greatest set of&hellip; no guys around, huh.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Does anybody need anything?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;ll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I&rsquo;ll get it. If I ask you to, you&rsquo;ll probably end up drinking it yourself.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That is so unfair.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.</p>
<p>[Ross enters]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel&rsquo;s trainer. He&rsquo;s gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.</p>
<p>[Chandler enters]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Stick a fork what?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Like, when you&rsquo;re cooking a steak.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, OK, I don&rsquo;t eat meat.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> OK, then, eat me, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;ve met the perfect woman. OK, we&rsquo;re sitting on her couch, we&rsquo;re fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, &rsquo;do you ever want to do it in an elevator?&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What did you say?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahh, I believe my exact words were, &lsquo;Flaign,en - sten&rsquo;. I mean I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That is the most ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You sold me out.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I did not sell you out.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes you did. Absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ow, you stop flicking.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You flicked me first.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, now I&rsquo;m gonna kick some ass.</p>
<p>[Phoebe grabs each of them by an ear]</p>

<p><b>Van Damme:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.</p>
<p><b>Van Damme:</b> Normally, I would not do it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, what made you make the exception for me?</p>
