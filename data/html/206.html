<p><b>Monica:</b> There&rsquo;s my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica, Ben cries. When he moves Ben away, he stops crying. He does that a couple times.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Cool.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> He hates me. My nephew hates me.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on, don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it&rsquo;s gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don&rsquo;t even have a boyfriend yet. (Monica glares at him.) Joey, she does not look fat.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, continued from earlier. Chandler has a basketball.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Chandler) Here you go. (Sets a drink down in front of him.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> That is so funny. Let me see that a sec. (She throws the ball out the window)</p>
<p>(Ross starts to make some gurgling sounds.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you ok, Ross?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. What&rsquo;s in this pie?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, I don&rsquo;t know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Kiwi? Kiwi? You said it was a key lime pie.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No I didn&rsquo;t, I said kiwi lime. That&rsquo;s what makes it so special.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna kill me. I&rsquo;m allergic to kiwi.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No you&rsquo;re not. You&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re allergic to lobster and peanuts and&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ugh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my god.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ugh. It&rsquo;s definitely getting worse.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, get your coat, we&rsquo;re gonna go to the hospital.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Is he gonna be ok?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, he&rsquo;s just gotta get a shot.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (sitting back down) You know, you know, actually it&rsquo;s getting better. It is. It is. Let&rsquo;s not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Jacket now.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What about Ben? We can&rsquo;t bring a baby to a hospital.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We&rsquo;ll watch him.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t think tho.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I&rsquo;ve taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that&rsquo;s out the window.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there&rsquo;s extra milk in the fridge, and there&rsquo;s extra diapers in the bag.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hat, milk, got it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> ??? (speech garbled) Thro up a thro thro&mdash;a thro thro!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) <em>I&rsquo;m in the shower and I&rsquo;m writing a song. Stop me if you&rsquo;ve heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.</em></p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> F.Y.I.. I&rsquo;ve decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie&hellip; something. She&rsquo;s supposed to be very good.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> But what about Phoebe?</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Rachel, it&rsquo;s not that your friend is bad, it&rsquo;s that she&rsquo;s so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, ok, so you&rsquo;re not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Uh&hellip; (Points at Rachel.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing) <em>Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat&hellip;as needed.</em></p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Street, Chandler and Joey are loaded down with baby stuff, and Ben.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, I don&rsquo;t think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby&rsquo;s anvil?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s gonna be worth it. It&rsquo;s a known fact that women love babies, all right? Women love guys who love babies. It&rsquo;s that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o&rsquo; babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, I got him.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, seriously.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, seriously you want him?</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> Hello.</p>
<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> Hello.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> And who is this little cutie pie?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t think me immodest, but, me?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You wanna smell him?</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> I assume we&rsquo;re talking about the baby now.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah. He&rsquo;s got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> (She smells his head.) I think my uterus just skipped a beat.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Chandler) What&rsquo;d I tell you? What&rsquo;d I tell you?</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> I think it&rsquo;s great you guys are doing this.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, we are great guys.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel has just broken the news to Phoebe.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can&rsquo;t just erase chalk.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And he&rsquo;s going to be paying this woman? Why doesn&rsquo;t he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Terry is a jerk, ok? That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re always saying &ldquo;Terry&rsquo;s a jerk!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s where that came from.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. (She goes over to Terry.) All right, look, look. Why don&rsquo;t you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won&rsquo;t even be here. You don&rsquo;t pay her. It&rsquo;s not gonna cost you anything.</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> I, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on, Terry, I&rsquo;ll even clean the cappuccino machine.</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> You don&rsquo;t clean the cappuccino machine?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.</p>
<p>(Rachel goes back to Phoebe.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Done.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Who&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; for you babe?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well you said that he&rsquo;s paying the people who are playing.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, no, no no. I meant that he&rsquo;s gonna be paying that other woman beause she&rsquo;s a professional.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m not gonna be the only one who&rsquo;s not getting paid.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, but Pheebs&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, huh uh, I&rsquo;m sorry, no. No, I&rsquo;m not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.</p>
<p>[Time Lapse, Phoebe is on the sidewalk in front of Central Perk singing.]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing, angrily) <em>When I play, I play for me, I don&rsquo;t need your charity</em>. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la&hellip;</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Hospital, Ross and Monica are waiting for the doctor.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.</p>
<p><b>Doctor:</b> (entering) Hello, there. I&rsquo;m Dr. Carlin. I see someone&rsquo;s having an allergic reaction.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Monica) Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> My brother, the PhD would like to know if there&rsquo;s any way to treat this orally.</p>
<p><b>Doctor:</b> No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Tho?</p>
<p>(Monica shakes her head.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohhh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it&rsquo;s gotta be a needle. You&rsquo;re just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok. Oh boy. You are doin&rsquo; so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (He grabs her hand.) All right, Ross, don&rsquo;t squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don&rsquo;t squeeze it so hard! (The doctor puts in the needle.) Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Street, Chandler and Joey are still trying to pick up women with Ben.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, hey, look at that talent. (Motions to two girls waiting for the bus.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to taxi driver) Just practicing. You&rsquo;re good. Carry on.</p>
<p>(Chandler and Joey run to get on the bus.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wait-wait-wait-wait!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wait! Wait!</p>
<p>[Cut to on the bus.]</p>
<p><b>Girl No. 1:</b> Hey, you. He&rsquo;s just adorable.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he&rsquo;s too pink.</p>
<p><b>Girl No. 2:</b> So what are you guys out doing today?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh we&rsquo;re not out. No, no. We&rsquo;re just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin&rsquo; the usual straight guy stuff.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Joey) You done?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Girl No. 1:</b> Oh, there&rsquo;s our stop.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Get outta here. This is our stop too.</p>
<p><b>Girl No. 2:</b> You guys live around here too?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know it?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, look, since we&rsquo;re neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?</p>
<p>(They all get off the bus.)</p>
<p><b>Girl No. 1:</b> So uh, you wanna go to Marquel&rsquo;s?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, sure, they love us over there.</p>
<p><b>Girl No. 2:</b> Where&rsquo;s your baby?</p>
<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> (running after bus) Ben! Ben! Ben!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I&rsquo;m doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. (Listens) Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid character.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (grabbing the phone) Hi, here&rsquo;s the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It&rsquo;s white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. (Listens) (to Chandler) He wants to talk to you again.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m him.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Actually, uh, we&rsquo;re both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel is standing by the door and looking at Phoebe counting her money as Stephanie is singing.</h3>
<p><b>Stephanie:</b> (singing) <em>Just call me angel of the monring. Angel! Just touch my cheek before you leave me. Oh baby. Just call me angel of the morning. Angel! And slowly turn away. I won&rsquo;t beg you to stay, with me.</em></p>
<p>(Rachel goes outside.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Here. I thought you might be cold. (Hands her a cup of coffee.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, &rsquo;cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don&rsquo;t know, when I sang &ldquo;Su-Su-Suicide,&rdquo; I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, &ldquo;Smelly Cat,&rdquo; I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you know, honey, I don&rsquo;t think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you&rsquo;ve ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh! (Waves her hand over her head.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just all about the money.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for &ldquo;Smelly Cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really? From who?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, from me. And I know it&rsquo;s not your big money song, but it&rsquo;s my favorite.</p>
<p>(A kid runs up, who looks like, or will look a lot like Phoebe&rsquo;s brother.)</p>
<p><b>Kid:</b> Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It&rsquo;s kind of an emergency.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. Here you go.</p>
<p><b>Kid:</b> Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica and Ross are sitting on the couch.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I&rsquo;m sorry I,I almost broke your hand.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;m sorry I poisoned you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle? (Points to her hand.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian&rsquo;s pumpkin?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No. But I remember people telling me about it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I hope Ben has a little sister.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how &lsquo;bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That was you?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> They, uh, were infected. He wouldn&rsquo;t have made it.</p>
<p>(Chandler and Joey enter with what they hope is Ben.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There&rsquo;s my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. (She picks him up.) Hey, he&rsquo;s not crying.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he&rsquo;s not crying.</p>
<p>(Ben starts crying)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes! (Monica looks at him.) There&rsquo;s still pie.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m here. How&rsquo;s my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus&mdash;Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You, you are gonna love this.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Monica) Will you hold Ben for a sec? (Hands Ben off and starts to chase Joey and Chandler.) Come here. Come here.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (picking up the pie) Stay back, I&rsquo;ve got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!</p>
