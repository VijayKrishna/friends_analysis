<p><b>[Scene: Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s apartment. Chandler and Joey are sitting at the bar, in their bathrobes, eating cereal]</b></p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch&rsquo;s eyebrows are actually on his hat?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s weird? Joey, the man&rsquo;s been captain of a <b>cereal</b> for the last 40 years.</p>
<p>[Joey finishes his cereal, licks his spoon, and puts it back in the silverware drawer.]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Waaa-aaah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, so.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well don&rsquo;t you see how gross that is? I mean that&rsquo;s like you using my toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, that was only &rsquo;cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, why can&rsquo;t we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because soap is soap. It&rsquo;s self-cleaning.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Monica and Phoebe are sitting at the table, Joey and Chandler enter.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica &amp; Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What&rsquo;s the occasion?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you know that guy that&rsquo;s on my show that&rsquo;s in a coma? He&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; a brunch.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ahh.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> [enters from her room] OK, ready when you are.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okey-doke.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, but you can not tell Ross &rsquo;cause I want to surprise him.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow, this is wild. What&rsquo;re you gonna get?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, I&rsquo;m getting a lily for my Mom. &rsquo;Cause her name&rsquo;s Lily.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, that&rsquo;s lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So where you gettin&rsquo; it?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What&rsquo;s on your shoulder?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, a chip. A tattoo, I&rsquo;m getting a tattoo.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi. Well hey, you don&rsquo;t - you don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re kind of cool?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, sorry I don&rsquo;t. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn&rsquo;t come out right Phoebe? Then it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know, havin&rsquo; a bad hair cut all the time. Why&rsquo;s everyone staring at me?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oooh, Rich is goin&rsquo; to the party too, huh?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, he&rsquo;s my parents&rsquo; best friend, he has to be there.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, is today the day you&rsquo;re gonna tell them about you two?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. It&rsquo;s my dad&rsquo;s birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I think you should tell them.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, I don&rsquo;t even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I&rsquo;m not telling them anything.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, &lsquo;God I hope they get together.&rsquo;</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Gellers&rsquo; house. Monica, Ross, and Richard are arriving to Mr. Gellers birthday party.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Alright, shall we?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let&rsquo;s - let&rsquo;s switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we&rsquo;re trying to cover something up.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. [opens door] We&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh hi kids. Hi darling.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Happy birthday dad.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Oh thank you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi ma.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Happy birthday.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Gellers&rsquo; kitchen. Monica, Mrs. Geller and one of Mrs. Geller&rsquo;s friends are preparing the cake.</h3>
<p>Friend: Well, you kids take the train in?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.</p>
<p><b>Friend:</b> Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he&rsquo;s got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city. [Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Sooo, Richard&rsquo;s shopping in the junior section.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Are we still on that?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> We just know she&rsquo;s got the IQ of a napkin.</p>
<p><b>Friend:</b> She&rsquo;s probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up. [Monica folds her arms over her breasts]</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey&rsquo;s co-star&rsquo;s apartment. Chandler and Joey are at the brunch.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Can you believe this place?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, this is a great apartment.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there&rsquo;s mirrors on both sides of you. So when you&rsquo;re in there it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re peein&rsquo; with the Rockettes.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, there&rsquo;s my fantasy come true. No, seriously.</p>
<p><b>Joey&rsquo;s Co-Star:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! We were just sayin&rsquo;, great apartment man.</p>
<p><b>Joey&rsquo;s Co-Star:</b> Thanks. You want it?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Joey&rsquo;s Co-Star:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;m movin&rsquo; to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?</p>
<p><b>Joey&rsquo;s Co-Star:</b> Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C&rsquo;mon I&rsquo;ll show you the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> [being left behind] Oh that&rsquo;s all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Mr. Geller&rsquo;s party. Mr. Geller and a friend are questioning Richard while Ross observes.</h3>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> C&rsquo;mon, tell us.</p>
<p><b>Friend:</b> Yeah, is she really 20.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> I am not telling you guys anything.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> C&rsquo;mon Rich, it&rsquo;s my birthday, let me live vicariously.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Dad, you really don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Ahh, what&rsquo;s a little mid-life crisis between friends?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Jack, would you let it go?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Look, I know what you&rsquo;re going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You&hellip; you got your own little speedster.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Guys. Seriously, it is <b>not</b> like that.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> What? I&rsquo;m kidding. You know I&rsquo;d never let him touch the Porsche.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Tattoo parlor. Phoebe and Rachel are deciding on tattoos.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I like this lily. It&rsquo;s more open, ya know, and that&rsquo;s like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.</p>
<p><b>Tattoo Artist:</b> Alright, blonde girl, you&rsquo;re in room two, not so blonde girl, you&rsquo;re with me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Here we go.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> [reluctantly] Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You&rsquo;re not going?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What? Is it - is this &rsquo;cause of what Ross said?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Well, yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t believe this. Is this how this relationship&rsquo;s gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c&rsquo;mon what is this, 1922?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&rsquo;s 1922?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes I do, it&rsquo;s just that Ross is&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> OK, who is the boss of you?!!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. <b>GO</b>!!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Mr. Geller&rsquo;s birthday party. Monica is in the bathroom and Richard comes in.</h3>
<p><b>Richard:</b> How ya doin&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m a twinkie.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Really? I&rsquo;m a hero.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, this is so hard.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Maybe we should just tell your parents first.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> My parents are dead.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean&hellip; you know what I mean.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I&rsquo;ll go out first, alright.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> [walks out of the bathroom and runs into Mrs. Geller who is going to the bathroom] Judy, <b>going to the bathroom</b>, good for you.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.</p>
<p>[Monica jumps in the shower. Right after Mrs. Geller enters the bathroom, Mr. Geller peeks his head in.]</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn&rsquo;t believe I have one.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I know. He&rsquo;s like a new man. It&rsquo;s like a scene from <i>Cocoon</i>.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she&rsquo;s quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he&rsquo;s falling in love with her.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> I tell you, I&rsquo;ve never seen him this happy.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Of course not. With you it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve got two 25-year-olds.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> [they start kissing] Oh Jack stop.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> C&rsquo;mon, it&rsquo;s my birthday.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s apartment. Chandler and Joey are returning from their brunch.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Why would I want another apartment, huh? I&rsquo;ve already got an apartment that I love.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well it wouldn&rsquo;t kill you to say it once in a while.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright, you want the truth? I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; about it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m 28 years old, I&rsquo;ve never lived alone, and I&rsquo;m finally at a place where I&rsquo;ve got enough money that I don&rsquo;t need a roommate anymore.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Woah, woah, woah. I don&rsquo;t need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What&rsquo;re you gettin&rsquo; so bent out of shape for, huh? It&rsquo;s not like we agreed to live together forever. We&rsquo;re not Bert and Ernie.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well that&rsquo;s how I feel.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well then maybe you should take it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well then maybe I will.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fine with me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Great. Then you&rsquo;ll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Mr. Geller&rsquo;s birthday party. Mr. and Mrs. Geller enter looking particularly refreshed. Monica follows looking rather pale.</h3>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Who&rsquo;s drink can I freshen?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Almost time for cake.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Mon, Mon, are you OK?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You remember that video I found of mom and dad?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I just caught the live show.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Eww.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Mr. Geller&rsquo;s birthday party. Monica and Richard are alone in the kitchen.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey there.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Humm, really?</p>
<p>[Mrs. Geller and Ross both enter]</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Richard. Richard. Your son isn&rsquo;t seeing anyone is he?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Uhh, not that I know of.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Well, I was thinking, why doesn&rsquo;t he give Monica a call?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> That - that&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, actually, I&rsquo;m already seeing someone.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Oh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica&rsquo;s seeing someone?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren&rsquo;t. Is that crystal?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> So, who&rsquo;s the mystery man?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, uh, he&rsquo;s a doctor.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> A real doctor?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, a doctor of meat. Of course he&rsquo;s a real doctor. And he&rsquo;s handsome, and he&rsquo;s sweet, and know you&rsquo;d like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Well that&rsquo;s wonderful&hellip; I</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Mom, it&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> It is Judy.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> [enters with his bat] Found it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;ll take that dad. [grabs the bat]</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> That&rsquo;s impossible, he&rsquo;s got a twinkie in the city.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Dad, I&rsquo;m the twinkie.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> You&rsquo;re the twinkie?</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> She&rsquo;s not a twinkie.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I&rsquo;ve been in&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Oh please, a relationship.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you&rsquo;ve never seen Richard happier.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> When did I say that?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.</p>
<p>[Everyone else enters and all start singing <i>Happy Birthday</i>.]</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Tattoo parlor. Rachel is showing Phoebe her tattoo.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I&rsquo;m so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ahh. OK, let&rsquo;s see yours again.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh OK. [pulls over her shirt and shows a bare shoulder] Oh no, oh it&rsquo;s gone, that&rsquo;s so weird, I don&rsquo;t know how-where it went.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You didn&rsquo;t get it?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why didn&rsquo;t you get it?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, I mean what, what&rsquo;s this about your new place?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m movin&rsquo; out like we talked about.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well I didn&rsquo;t think that was serious. [grabs the spoons back] Ya know I thought that was just a fight.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no-no, it&rsquo;s uh, it&rsquo;s not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn&rsquo;t even get theirs accross the street.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> [quietly] Yeah, I remember.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, let&rsquo;s bring the rest of these down to the truck.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p>[Joey walks out and after a few seconds comes back in and gives Chandler a big hug. He then leaves for good and Chandler is left alone in his apartment.]</p>
