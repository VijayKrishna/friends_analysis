<p>{Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: This is an hour-long special episode. Which means that the first part of this episode is episode 615. The second part of this episode is episode 616. Since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file, that&rsquo;s why there is no episode 616 in the season 6 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 615 to 617.}</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, everyone is there as Rachel enters.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Ross) <b>What</b> is the matter with you?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! Barry and Mindy.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel) Who-who&rsquo;s Barry and Mindy?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh-oh, wasn&rsquo;t he cheating on you with her?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why did they get divorced?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn&rsquo;t that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know what you mean, I&rsquo;ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I&rsquo;d never gotten divorced.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Which time?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn&rsquo;t realized she was a lesbian.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (starts to imagine it) I can&rsquo;t. I keep seeing it the good way.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;d bet I&rsquo;d still be doing my kara-tay. (That&rsquo;s karate, he&rsquo;s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y&rsquo;know, not doing anything else physical.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t be dating me, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure I would!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> (simultaneously) Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What, you guys really think that I&rsquo;m that shallow?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I just think Monica was that fat.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, imagine if I never got fired off <i>Days Of Our Lives</i>! (Closes his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, there&rsquo;s Carol again!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I&rsquo;d probably be writing for the <i>New Yorker</i>, getting paid to be funny. But my job&rsquo;s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don&rsquo;t have to wear a tie.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What if I had taken that job at <i>Merrill Lynch</i>?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>Merrill Lynch</i>?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well why didn&rsquo;t you take the job?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y&rsquo;know that if I&rsquo;d work with stocks, I&rsquo;d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we&rsquo;d still hang out?</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>
<p>{Transcriber&rsquo;s note: This is where the opening credits are, but they&rsquo;re not the usual opening credits. <b>Oh no</b>! These credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. It starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as Fat Monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. It then goes on to show Rachel&rsquo;s still a shop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then they&rsquo;re dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a groupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesn&rsquo;t apply, for instance, Ross and Rachel have no history. And in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.}</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A newsstand, Ross is buying a magazine and gets in line behind a woman.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (gasps) Rob Tillman!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no. It&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s me, Ross!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. Ross Tillman.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no-no, Ross Geller.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, of course Monica&rsquo;s brother!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Right.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! How are you?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Good-good, I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m married. (Shows her his ring.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! Me too!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Is-isn&rsquo;t it the best?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.) So, umm how&rsquo;s Monica?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she&rsquo;s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, I would love too.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? Oh-oh, she&rsquo;d be so excited!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! Okay!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on! (They start to leave.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wait, don&rsquo;t you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine) Busty Ladies?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it&rsquo;s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> But! Don&rsquo;t you have to give him his money back?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, let&rsquo;s go see Monica!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey, Fat Monica, and her boyfriend are sitting on the couch. Monica&rsquo;s boyfriend is getting up to get something. For future reference, for the rest of this episode Monica&rsquo;s fat, I won&rsquo;t be calling her Fat Monica throughout.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> He&rsquo;s not boring! He&rsquo;s just-he&rsquo;s just low key.</p>
<p><b>Monica&rsquo;s Boyfriend:</b> (returning) Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte. (Hands it to Monica and sits down.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Monica&rsquo;s Boyfriend:</b> Yeah. Y&rsquo;know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it&rsquo;s a seed.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (not impressed) Wow!!</p>
<p><b>Monica&rsquo;s Boyfriend:</b> Can anyone else name a well known seed that&rsquo;s been masquerading as a nut?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, depressed) Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no! What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not &ldquo;<i>Archie</i> Comic funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica&rsquo;s Boyfriend:</b> Y&rsquo;know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica&rsquo;s Boyfriend:</b> (kisses her) Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye.</p>
<p><b>Monica&rsquo;s Boyfriend:</b> Bye-bye. (Gets up to leave.) Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut. (Exits.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Was his question what&rsquo;s more boring than him?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey man, look sorry about that <i>Archie</i> thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ehh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Maybe Joey doesn&rsquo;t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s great! That would be great! Let&rsquo;s do that!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I could use the money; it could give me time to write.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh right great! Welcome aboard!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don&rsquo;t need any assistance in there, take a break!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right!</p>
<p>(As Joey goes to the bathroom, Corporate Phoebe enters. She&rsquo;s wearing a business suit and carrying a briefcase.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Phoebe! Guess what?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh that&rsquo;s so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it&rsquo;s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s okay, you&rsquo;re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.</p>
<p>(She hangs up as Ross and Rachel enter.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Mon!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug, which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight? (She&rsquo;s not quite sure of that one.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And that&rsquo;s Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we&rsquo;ve seen each other?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (answering it) 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon&rsquo;s party. I played you one of my songs, y&rsquo;know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah. Right. So now, are&mdash;do you, do you still do music?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime! I&rsquo;ll play you one of my other&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from <i>Days of Our Lives</i>, just walked in here!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, he&rsquo;s a friend of ours.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well it&rsquo;s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Rachel) Hey-hey, <b>or</b> I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> He&rsquo;s coming over! He&rsquo;s coming over!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (getting up) Joey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (holding a plate of what looks like <i>Rice Crispies Treats</i>) I know, here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohhh! (Takes the plate.) No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (giggles and can&rsquo;t look at him) Hi!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (shaking Rachel&rsquo;s hand) Hi!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, it&rsquo;s always nice to meet the fans.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ah!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (turning and whispering to Monica) She&rsquo;s not crazy is she?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Rachel) So uh, how you doin&rsquo;?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe are there. Phoebe&rsquo;s cell phone rings and she goes through her little routine of lighting a cigarette before answering the phone.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! (Answering the phone.) Go!! Who&rsquo;s this? (Listens) Oh okay, you&rsquo;re gonna like working for me. What&rsquo;s your name? (Listens) What kind of name is Brendy? I&hellip; Whatever&hellip; Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey there you are!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh-oh, it&rsquo;s my boss!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, here&rsquo;s a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I&rsquo;m delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (Exits.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) You realize what you are don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You&rsquo;re his bitch.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (yelling from Monica&rsquo;s room) No-no!! No!!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (panicked) Oh wait! You didn&rsquo;t just sit on my <i>Kit-Kats</i> did you?!!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> But the <i>Kit-Kats</i> are all right?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can&rsquo;t call my office they&rsquo;ll kill me! I can&rsquo;t call my clients they&rsquo;ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (louder) My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes!!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Then yes that is what I&rsquo;m having. (Takes another puff of the cigarette.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A hospital, Phoebe is recovering from her heart attack as Ross, Monica, and Chandler are there to comfort and support her.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on Pheebs, it&rsquo;s not that bad! Y&rsquo;know most people would be excited if they didn&rsquo;t have to work for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Most people don&rsquo;t like their jobs, I <b>love</b> my job! I have not been working for three hours and I&rsquo;m already going crazy. I miss Joan.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, having a heart attack is nature&rsquo;s way of telling you to slow it down.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I always thought having a heart attack was nature&rsquo;s way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you&rsquo;re not gonna die. I mean, you are <b>going</b> to die, but you&rsquo;re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Let&rsquo;s take a walk. (They start to leave.) Y&rsquo;know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Ross) So what&rsquo;s going on with you?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well umm, I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Still going through that dry spell with Carol?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How long has it been since you had sex?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, last weekend&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh that&rsquo;s not so bad.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &hellip;will be two months&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &hellip;since I stopped trying.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe you need to spice things up a little.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What-what do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know, dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Roll playing&hellip; You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I think I got it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you&rsquo;re-you&rsquo;re-you&rsquo;re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody&rsquo;s watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A hospital hallway, Chandler is sitting on a gurney with his hands spread out behind his back. Then Monica comes and plops down on the gurney and one of his hands. Chandler immediately recoils in extreme pain.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Sorry. So how&rsquo;s it going with Joey?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, &ldquo;Bring me food.&rdquo; Two is, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with a girl, bring us food.&rdquo; Three is, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lost and I can&rsquo;t find food.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! She&rsquo;s right in there! (Points to Phoebe&rsquo;s room.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh great. (Starts to go in.) (To Chandler) Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Silvercup Studios, Joey is showing Rachel around the set.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, and over there is Brady&rsquo;s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, <b>that</b> is a large piece of television equipment. (Points at a large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.) And uh <b>that</b> is an old man! Hey old man!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Wow! Umm, y&rsquo;know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Why? (In Drake&rsquo;s voice.) Why can&rsquo;t the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (awestruck, then not) Isn&rsquo;t that a line from the show?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drake&rsquo;s voice) I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s a line from the show too!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, you watch too much TV.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (approaching) Here you go Joe, here&rsquo;s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, there&rsquo;s pulp in that. (Hands it back.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I thought we talked about this. I don&rsquo;t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn&rsquo;t juice. All juice, okay?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.) Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) Iced tea.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, anything for you sir?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Rachel) Did I not just tell him?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (mouthing it to him) Yes, you did.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares at him.) You&rsquo;re gonna throw that juice at me, aren&rsquo;t ya?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross and Carol&rsquo;s, Ross is trying to talk to Carol about what Phoebe told him.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Carol our sex life is&mdash;it&rsquo;s just not working&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ben:</b> (entering) <b>Dad</b>!! (Runs and hugs him.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don&rsquo;t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don&rsquo;t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!</p>
<p><b>Ben:</b> Yay! (Runs off.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yay! (To Carol) Seriously, our sex life&hellip; I was thinking, maybe I don&rsquo;t know, we could try some-some new things. Y&rsquo;know? For fun?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Like what?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I don&rsquo;t know umm, (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up? (Carol&rsquo;s shocked and obviously doesn&rsquo;t like that idea.) Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. (Carol doesn&rsquo;t like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, y&rsquo;know we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> (quickly) I love that idea!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Monica is eating breakfast as Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Who sold a story to <i>Archie</i> Comics?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! That&rsquo;s great! Oh wow! (Hugs him.) You&rsquo;re a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Aww.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute! (Quickly checks her pockets and pulls out&hellip;) My last <i>Kit-Kat</i> bar!</p>
<p>(Chandler tries to take it, but Monica won&rsquo;t let go. He tugs harder, and she still doesn&rsquo;t budge.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You wanna share it?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay!!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you&rsquo;re mad, but I just want to say I&rsquo;m sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y&rsquo;know? I mean, y&rsquo;know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s <b>not</b> mayonnaise!!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I&rsquo;m sorry. Here. (Hands him a cup.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Fresh squeezed orange juice, <b>with</b> pulp! Just the way you like it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to <i>Archie</i> Comics!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God! That&rsquo;s great! Congratulations! What&rsquo;s the story?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh you wouldn&rsquo;t uh, care. It&rsquo;s just a stupid comic book story.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he doesn&rsquo;t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist&mdash;as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can&rsquo;t have lumps in them.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Say it louder, I don&rsquo;t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!</p>
<p><b>Guy All the Way in the Back:</b> Yeah, I heard it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s not like, I haven&rsquo;t any opportunities. I mean, y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;m just waiting for the perfect guy. I&rsquo;m seeing this guy Roger, all right? He&rsquo;s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y&rsquo;know, give him my flower.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Ooh, actually I&rsquo;ve been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someone&rsquo;s been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I know. (Laughs) Y&rsquo;know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh, me too.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> But, I put some honey in it.</p>
<p>(Phoebe mocks what Monica just said. Ross pulls Chandler aside.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She doesn&rsquo;t know she was fired yet, does she?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, the doctors say it may kill her.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you two girls whispering about over there?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) But <b>I</b> think we should tell her.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! (Points at Ross.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen Phoebe, he&rsquo;s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know! But if I didn&rsquo;t work there, what else would I do?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, you used to like playing the guitar.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, what about y&rsquo;know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change&mdash;ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you&mdash;ready for a refill?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I probably shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;so I will! (Joey starts making her refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s raining!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Pretty cool, huh? But if you&rsquo;re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn&rsquo;t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you&rsquo;d be wrong.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, can I use your bathroom?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s uh, right through there. (Points.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (Starts to go.) God y&rsquo;know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani&rsquo;s apartment&hellip;</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And then we&rsquo;re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Roger:</b> Y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no-no, no! It&rsquo;s sensual!</p>
<p><b>Dr. Roger:</b> Ohh! Didn&rsquo;t know! Okay!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!</p>
<p><b>Dr. Roger:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry sweetie, it&rsquo;s the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m Ross by the way.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> (not taking her eyes off Carol) Hello Ross. (Takes off her coat and hands it to him.) I love what you&rsquo;ve done with this space.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Thank you so much.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> How hot is this?!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Chandler and Monica are eating Monica&rsquo;s dinner.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re here with me instead of Roger.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I could make it seem like he&rsquo;s here. (Imitates him.) &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn&rsquo;t add the second cous until 1979.&rdquo; (Mumbles something further.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Stop it!! That&rsquo;s not funny!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No. He&rsquo;s not a horrible guy.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey that&rsquo;s what I tell girls about me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, I&rsquo;m gonna die a virgin!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I was kidding.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! Tell me something Joey&mdash;(She falls off the couch)&mdash;Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah you did.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Phoebe&rsquo;s, continued from earlier. Monica and Chandler are still discussing the previous question.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y&rsquo;know? Because you&rsquo;ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to disappoint you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you&rsquo;re horrible, how would I know?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I do like that.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out another friend. (Points at herself.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Stop it! We&rsquo;re doing this! Let&rsquo;s do it!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, let&rsquo;s just forget it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>
<p>(She turns out the lights and in the darkened room Chandler starts to moan.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> The ring from the cave, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow! Uh okay, well uh&hellip; (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Jack:</b> Uh, Phoebe you-you don&rsquo;t have an office.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;ll work here. This is goo, next to this plant. (She picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)</p>
<p><b>Jack:</b> (approaches her) Phoebe, listen&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You&rsquo;re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking <b>big</b> bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Jack:</b> You lost 13 million dollars.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, so this is all about money! Y&rsquo;know it&rsquo;s bad enough that&mdash;Ow! Oh, you have <b>got</b> to be kidding!</p>
<p><b>Jack:</b> Are you all right?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m having another heart attack!</p>
<p><b>Jack:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!</p>
<p><b>Jack:</b> Take it easy. (Sits her down.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Arthur, he&rsquo;s the guy calling 9-1-1) Dumbass!</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> Hey Pheebs! How&rsquo;s it going?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, they fired me and I&rsquo;m having heart attack.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> Wow! Well, welcome back!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross is there as Rachel storms in.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi Ross!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Is Joey Tribbiani here?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm, no.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I&rsquo;m looking for him and that this I am <b>not</b> gonna throw up!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That-that&rsquo;s always good news. Are you okay?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Me? I&rsquo;m great! I&rsquo;m fine! I&rsquo;m sooo good!! But, you know who&rsquo;s not great?! Men! You&rsquo;re a man right Ross?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sit down!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. (He does so.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean <b>squat</b> to you people?! And why is it that the <b>second</b> we tell you we&rsquo;re going out of town, <b>bamn</b> there you are in bed with the neighbor&rsquo;s dog walker?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> We&rsquo;re sorry.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No seriously! Seriously! <b>What</b> has happened to the sanctity of marriage?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Didn&rsquo;t you spend last night at Joey&rsquo;s?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Aw what are you?! A detective?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look I-I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. (Doesn&rsquo;t believe it.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! There are <b>some</b> men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a <b>two</b>some with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who are these men?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Men. I guy I know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers) gay.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She is not&hellip; (Realizes) She&rsquo;s gay. Oh my God. She is <b>so</b> gay! I can&rsquo;t believe this.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good day for married people huh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry your husband cheated on you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren&rsquo;t that great either.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Try telling my wife that.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Monica is blowing out a candle as Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why would you do that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because you shouldn&rsquo;t be with him. (Pause.) You should be with me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don&rsquo;t just happen. Y&rsquo;know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y&rsquo;know I was just lying there and I couldn&rsquo;t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y&rsquo;know with a friend.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know you probably don&rsquo;t want to go out with me, y&rsquo;know because I make too many jokes and I&rsquo;ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I&rsquo;m not technically a &ldquo;doctor&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Monica runs over and kisses him.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> There was just one woman, wasn&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, there were two.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Including me?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Phoebe is singing a new song as the gang looks on.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (singing)</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see&hellip;<br>
 One of them won&rsquo;t do it, but the second one will set you free&hellip;<br>
 Tell all your hate and anger, it&rsquo;s time to say good-bye&hellip;<br>
 And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!<br>
 La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la&hellip;&hellip;</p>
