<h3><b>Scene:</b> Rachel and Monica&rsquo;s, everyone is getting ready to go to a banquet</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. (takes a glass from the fridge.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Taste it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) Yep, it&rsquo;s fat. I drank fat!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, mister tux!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why aren&rsquo;t you guys dressed?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We have a half hour.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Relax Ross, we&rsquo;ll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, you know, I&rsquo;d feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.</p>
<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> Okay. (they don&rsquo;t move)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from bathroom) Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Really.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> How come you didn&rsquo;t come over earlier?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &rsquo;Cause, I&rsquo;m a stupid, stupid man.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Ross, want some cider?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No. (to Rachel) So, um, let&rsquo;s see your pretty close, huh. Make-up&rsquo;s on, hair&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I just have to get dressed.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! Once, I figure out what I&rsquo;m wearing.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Glass of fat?</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s. Ross is acting nervous</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What&rsquo;s a matter Ross? What you&rsquo;re nervous about your speech?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No! Do you wanna hear it?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Am I in it?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hello.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow, hello! You look great!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you! I know, though.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, well, you&rsquo;re my lucky penny.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering from bathroom, with an issue of Cosmo) All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re in my seat.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> How is this your seat?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &rsquo;Cause I was sitting there.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But then you left.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, it&rsquo;s not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What&rsquo;s the big deal, sit somewhere else.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that&rsquo;s my seat.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to the bathroom). Soo&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hi.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right all ready.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Ross) Ooh, are you gonna do magic?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s funny. Change!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hang on a second I just got in.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I don&rsquo;t care it starts at eight, we can&rsquo;t be late.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We could not, would not want to wait.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Has somebody been drinking my fat? (Joey and Chandler look at each other)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from her bedroom) You guys, (holds up an outfit) does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, you might be the first one.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, did you check the machine?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It&rsquo;s called: Get Up.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! You can have the chair.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my, would you look at that! (holds up crossed fingers)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (on machine) &ldquo;Hi, it&rsquo;s me, I&rsquo;m coming over now. Hey, what if I&rsquo;m already there when your playing this message?&rdquo; (to the guys) Is that too spooky?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (on machine) &ldquo;Hi Rach, are you there? It&rsquo;s me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from her bedroom) What?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Nevermind.</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> (on machine) &ldquo;Monica, it&rsquo;s Richard. Call me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Is-is-is that message old or new? (yelling) Old or new?! Old or new?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s old, it&rsquo;s definitely old. Didn&rsquo;t you hear the, the double beep?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What if it&rsquo;s new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn&rsquo;t I call him back?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Honey, you did call him back. &rsquo;Cause, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s really old.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Huh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&hellip;got&hellip;dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. (Rachel starts to follow Monica into her room, but Ross stops her and sends her back to her room.) There we go, there we go.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know what, okay, fine. Don&rsquo;t get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don&rsquo;t mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in front of Joey&rsquo;s face) Op, not touching, can&rsquo;t get mad! Not touching can&rsquo;t get mad! Not touching can&rsquo;t get mad! (Joey flings some dip onto Phoebe&rsquo;s dress)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!</p>
<p><b>Chandler and Joey:</b> Sorry Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What am I gonna do?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, rub it! Don&rsquo;t! (clapping) What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, thanks. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll try that.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Maybe he&rsquo;s calling to say your obsessive and crazy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So, should I call him back?</p>
<p><b>The Guys:</b> Noo! (Monica starts to go back into her room and stops) NO!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, fine, you know what, we&rsquo;ll both sit in the chair. (sits on Joey&rsquo;s lap) I&rsquo;m soooo, comfortable.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right! (jumps up)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he&rsquo;ll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right! Fine! I&rsquo;m going. But when I get back it&rsquo;s chair sitting, and I&rsquo;m the guy who&rsquo;s&hellip;sitting in a chair! (leaves)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from her room) Is this a little too&hellip; (sees Phoebe) Pheebs, what happened?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hummus. I got the hummus.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooooh! Honey, well we&rsquo;ll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That won&rsquo;t go with this dress though.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, you&rsquo;re right. Well, we&rsquo;ll find something. Let&rsquo;s just get you out of that. Come on.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I called him.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Nooo.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn&rsquo;t breezy?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, how could it not be breezy, no, &rsquo;cause, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re in such a breezy place.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Here, I got it. I&rsquo;ll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it&rsquo;s breezy enough.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Monica, how are you gonna do that?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know the code to his answering machine.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, Mon, I really don&rsquo;t think this is the&hellip; Okay, you&rsquo;re dialing, you are dialing.</p>
<p>(Chandler enters, and Joey is standing near the chair, they have a show down to see who gets the chair and Joey wins)</p>
<p><b>Richard:</b> (on machine) &ldquo;Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Machine:</b> &ldquo;You have two new messages.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow, what a cool job. (in a machine voice) &lsquo;You have two new messages.&rsquo; &lsquo;Please, pass the pie.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (on machine) &ldquo;Hi, it&rsquo;s Monica. I&rsquo;m just checking in &rsquo;cause I got this message from you and I didn&rsquo;t know if it was old or new or what. So, I&rsquo;m just checkin&rsquo;. So let me know, or don&rsquo;t, whatever. I&rsquo;m breezy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, you can&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.</p>
<p><b>Woman&rsquo;s Voice:</b> (on machine) Hola, it&rsquo;s me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Now she sounded breezy.</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, continued from earlier</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> He&rsquo;s seeing someone. I can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s seeing someone.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Monica, you don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, who&rsquo;s voice was that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Maybe it was his sister&rsquo;s. You know, maybe it was his daughter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, great. It&rsquo;s starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t know what your wearing?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, hon-ey. I&rsquo;m just trying to look nice for your big night.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I&rsquo;ll just pick something out for you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, &ldquo;Get out of my chair, dillhole!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You said I had to give you the chair, you didn&rsquo;t say anything about the cushions.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> The cushions are the essence of the chair!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s right! I&rsquo;m taking the essence.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh-ho, it&rsquo;ll be back. Oh-ho, there&rsquo;s nobody in the room.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I&rsquo;m sorry, I thought it looked pretty.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I didn&rsquo;t recognize it without that inflatable sheep.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh Rach, good, listen isn&rsquo;t this perfect for me! (she&rsquo;s wearing another dress on a hanger around her neck)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s perfect! But not for tonight.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No honey, we&rsquo;re sorry, we didn&rsquo;t mean it. I love you. I love you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We used them as pillows when we went camping.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (shyly) The sheep.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, what you do on your own time&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Where&rsquo;s my underwear?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> He took my essence!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can&rsquo;t you just wear the underwear you&rsquo;re wearing now?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Because, I&rsquo;m not wearing any underwear now.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s a rented tux. Okay. I&rsquo;m not gonna go commando in another man&rsquo;s fatigues.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, you hide my clothes. I&rsquo;m gonna do the exact opposite to you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you, what are you gonna <b>show</b> me my clothes?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> He&rsquo;s got nothing!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering from Rachel&rsquo;s room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) Okay, I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p><b>Ross and Chandler:</b> Oh, aaaah!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Rachel, didn&rsquo;t have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, &lsquo;All right, fine I&rsquo;ll be political.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you supporting?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Duh!! Christmas!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, hey, that&rsquo;s okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes&hellip; Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. (shows Chandler) Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn&rsquo;t going around any more. (grabs Chandler&rsquo;s watch) What time is it? It&rsquo;s 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering from her room) Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Just, just, just pick one!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how &lsquo;bout you go without any pants. Look, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don&rsquo;t care if they match. I don&rsquo;t care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> But I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering from her room) Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I&rsquo;m sorry, I just have to.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It was, it was her voice.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Monica, I think you&rsquo;ve gone over to the bad place.</p>
<p><b>Michelle:</b> Hola! Hello. Hello?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. That was her right?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> See there you go. Woo! We&rsquo;re out of the woods. Okay, I&rsquo;ll get dressed now.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yay!</p>
<p>(phone rings)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;ll get it, okay. (answers phone) Hi, Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s. (listens) Yeah, just a second, can I ask who&rsquo;s calling. (to Monica) Oh, ew, it&rsquo;s Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (on phone) Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. (listens) Oh, you&rsquo;re so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it&rsquo;s that&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Phoebe) You know what&rsquo;s weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he&rsquo;s getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (on phone) Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that&rsquo;s allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn&rsquo;t tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you&rsquo;re not comfortable with this? Come on we&rsquo;re friends!! (Michelle hangs up) That bitch always hated me. I&rsquo;m calling her back.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, fine. (runs to her room)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> They got a phone in there, right?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, we&rsquo;re on it. We&rsquo;re on it.</p>
<p>(Rachel comes out from her room wearing sweat pants and a sweatshirt)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m not gonna gooo.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re not going to go.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I think I&rsquo;m gonna catch up on my correspondence.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> How, how, um how can you not be going?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Um, you know, just out of curiosity&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I&rsquo;m just, I don&rsquo;t know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Right. Right, okay, okay. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry I yelled.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, but, your-your mad.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m not mad.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m just not going.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Your not going.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. You know that I-I have to go.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, hum.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Right. So is it gonna be like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m abandoning you while your upset.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, because your not upset.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> About the yelling.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right, and the humiliating.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, hum.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> We&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Honey?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, Ross. (turns toward him)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I love you. (goes to kiss her and she turns away.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (yelling from the bedroom) Get away from that! No! (she comes into the living room carrying the phone) She&rsquo;s just getting dressed.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?</p>
<p>(Joey enters wearing a lot of clothes)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I&rsquo;m wearing everything you own.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody&rsquo;s underwear!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look at me! I&rsquo;m Chandler! Could I <b>be</b> wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn&rsquo;t going commando&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oooo-ooh!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Whew, it&rsquo;s hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don&rsquo;t know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I&rsquo;m sick of this. Okay. I&rsquo;ve had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Jeez, what a baby.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You know what I don&rsquo;t care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she&rsquo;s not even gonna go. Look Rach, I&rsquo;m sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I&rsquo;m sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You could drink the fat.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I think you <b>should</b> drink the fat.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yaaaay!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That&rsquo;s been sitting out.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. (starts to drink, but Rachel stops him just before he starts drinking)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ll go, I&rsquo;ll go!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You will?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You were really gonna do that, weren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You were gonna drink the fat.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Let&rsquo;s see what else he&rsquo;ll do!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Joey) How &lsquo;bout instead you, go get changed! (to Chandler) You, give him back his underwear! I&rsquo;m gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!</p>
<p>(Joey and Chandler start to leave, Joey is lunging as he is walking)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Stop it. Stop it!</p>
<p>(Monica runs into the living room, and starts dialing the phone)</p>
