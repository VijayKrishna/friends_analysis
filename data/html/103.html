<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe is there.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hi guys!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hey, Pheebs! Hi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey. Oh, oh, how&rsquo;d it go?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said &ldquo;We should do this again!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Ohh. Ouch.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? He said &ldquo;we should do it again&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s good, right?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, no. Loosely translated &ldquo;We should do this again&rdquo; means &ldquo;You will never see me naked&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Since when?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Since always. It&rsquo;s like dating language. Y&rsquo;know, like &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not you&rdquo; means &ldquo;It is you&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Or &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a nice guy&rdquo; means &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Or, or, y&rsquo;know, um, &ldquo;I think we should see other people&rdquo; means &ldquo;Ha, ha, I already am&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And everybody knows this?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Cushions the blow.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, Ross.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What? Wh- hello? The Millners&rsquo; farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- &hellip;Oh my God, Chi Chi!</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is helping Joey rehearse for a part.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &ldquo;So how does it feel knowing you&rsquo;re about to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &ldquo;Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you&rsquo;ll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, that was really good!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks! Let&rsquo;s keep going.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. &ldquo;So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &ldquo;I just wanna go back to my cell. &rsquo;Cause in my cell, I can smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &ldquo;Smoke away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He fumbles and drops the lighter. Then he lights a cigarett, takes a drag, and coughs.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Relax your hand!</p>
<p>(Joey lets his wrist go limp.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Not so much!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoah!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright, now try taking a puff.</p>
<p>(Joey tries and visibly winces.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.</p>
<p>(Joey reluctantly gives him the cigarette.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Don&rsquo;t think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that&rsquo;s been missing from your hand. When you&rsquo;re holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&rsquo;miss it?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene, Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Rachel is there.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, no, no. They say it&rsquo;s the same as the distance from the tip of a guy&rsquo;s thumb to the tip of his index finger.</p>
<p>(The guys stretch out their fingers.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s ridiculous!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Can I use.. either thumb?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don&rsquo;t tell me, don&rsquo;t tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at this!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Yeah. Yeah, excellent.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (leaving to serve others) Good for me!</p>
<p>(The gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as Phoebe enters. She sits down without saying hi.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&rsquo;okay, Phoebe?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah- no- I&rsquo;m just- it&rsquo;s, I haven&rsquo;t worked- It&rsquo;s my bank.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What did they do to you?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s just- Okay. I&rsquo;m going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Easy.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> - and there&rsquo;s five hundred extra dollars in my account.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, Satan&rsquo;s minions at work again&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, &rsquo;cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you talking about? Keep it!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s not mine, I didn&rsquo;t earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Okay, let&rsquo;s say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I&rsquo;d hear, with every step I took? &ldquo;Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.&rdquo; And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- &ldquo;Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We&rsquo;re with you. We got it.</p>
<p>(Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. I&rsquo;d- just- I&rsquo;d never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler, what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?</p>
<p>(Chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a mouthful of smoke.)</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh! Oh, God!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What is this?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m smoking. I&rsquo;m smoking, I&rsquo;m smoking.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, I can&rsquo;t believe you! You&rsquo;ve been so good, for three years!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And this- is my reward!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, so this time I won&rsquo;t quit!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Ohhh! Put it out!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right! I&rsquo;m putting it out, I&rsquo;m putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe&rsquo;s coffee.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, no! I- I can&rsquo;t drink this now!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright. I&rsquo;m gonna go change, I&rsquo;ve got a date.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> This Alan again? How&rsquo;s it goin&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &rsquo;s&rsquo;going pretty good, y&rsquo;know? It&rsquo;s nice, and, we&rsquo;re having fun.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So when do we get to meet the guy?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Let&rsquo;s see, today&rsquo;s Monday&hellip; Never.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh, come on! Come on!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No. Not after what happened with Steve.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, I don&rsquo;t even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, then can we meet him?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nope. Schhorry.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they&rsquo;re all over him. I mean, they&rsquo;re like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.</p>
<p><b>Paula:</b> Listen. As someone who&rsquo;s seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I&rsquo;ll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they&rsquo;re your friends, they&rsquo;re just looking out after you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know. I just wish that once, I&rsquo;d bring a guy home that they actually liked.</p>
<p><b>Paula:</b> Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Chandler is smoking out on the balcony, Phoebe is absent.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Let it go, Ross.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, well, you didn&rsquo;t know Chi Chi.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you all promise?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Yeah! We promise! We&rsquo;ll be good!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?</p>
<p>(Chandler makes a &lsquo;Cross my heart&rsquo; sign. It starts to rain and he taps on the window.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!</p>
<p>(Chandler sulkilty picks up a garbage can lid and uses it as an umbrella.)</p>
<p>(Phoebe enters, walks to the couch, sits down, and begins to read a letter without saying hi.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, Pheebs.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &ldquo;Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We&rsquo;re sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you&rsquo;ll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -<i>football phone</i> as our free gift.&rdquo; Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What bank is this?</p>
<p>(The intercom buzzes.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey. It&rsquo;s him. (On the intercom) Who is it?</p>
<p><b>Alan:</b> (on the intercom) It&rsquo;s Alan.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He&rsquo;s here!</p>
<p>(Chandler comes in, dripping wet.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to all) Okay, please be good, <i>please</i>. Just remember how much you all like me.</p>
<p>(She opens the door and Alan enters.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.</p>
<p><b>Alan:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hi, Alan.</p>
<p><b>Alan:</b> I&rsquo;ve heard schho much about all you guyschh!</p>
<p>(Everyone laughs.)</p>
<p>[Time lapse, Alan is leaving.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Alan) Thanks. I&rsquo;ll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let&rsquo;s let the Alan-bashing begin. Who&rsquo;s gonna take the first shot, hmm?</p>
<p>(Silence.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> C&rsquo;mon!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &hellip;I&rsquo;ll go. Let&rsquo;s start with the way he kept picking at- no, I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t do this, can&rsquo;t do this. We loved him.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Loved him! Yeah! He&rsquo;s great!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute! We&rsquo;re talking about someone that <i>I&rsquo;m</i> going out with?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And did you notice&hellip;? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.)</p>
<p><b>The Guys:</b> (reluctantly) Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &hellip;What shoe?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> From the nursery rhyme. &ldquo;There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a&hellip; while&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Dubious pause.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &hellip;So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y&rsquo;know, it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yeah. I&rsquo;d marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I&rsquo;m gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You know what I like most about him, though?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> The way he makes me feel about myself.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Yeah&hellip;</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Monica is alone as Ross, Rachel, Chandler, and Joey enter dejectedly in softball gear.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.. how was the game?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well..</p>
<p><b>All:</b> WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Alan.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Can I ask you guys a question? D&rsquo;you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> ..I dunno, a little too Alan?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, no. That&rsquo;s impossible. You can never be too Alan.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I personally could have a gallon of Alan.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A street, Phoebe walks up to a homeless person (Lizzie) she knows.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Lizzie.</p>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Hey, Weird Girl.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I brought you alphabet soup.</p>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Did you pick out the vowels?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes. But I left in the Ys. &rsquo;Cause, y&rsquo;know, &ldquo;sometimes y&rdquo;. Uh, I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)</p>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Saltines?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?</p>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there&rsquo;s really money in here.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Weird Girl, what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I want you to have it. I don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, that&rsquo;s fine, no.</p>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Would you like my tin-foil hat?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. &rsquo;Cause you need that. No, it&rsquo;s okay, thanks.</p>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Please, let me do something.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we&rsquo;re even. Okay?</p>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s office, Chandler looks around, opens his desk drawer, takes a puff of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray. He types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette. While not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a squirt of air freshener and gags.</h3>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Street, Phoebe and Lizzie are at a hot dog vendor.</h3>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don&rsquo;t wanna pretzel?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p><b>Lizzie:</b> (leaves) See ya.</p>
<p>(Phoebe opens the can and reacts.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Huh!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Phoebe is telling everyone about her discovery.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> A <i>thumb</i>?!</p>
<p>(Phoebe nods.)</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Eww!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, maybe it&rsquo;s a contest, y&rsquo;know? Like, collect all five?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does, um, anyone wanna see?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Nooo!</p>
<p>(Chandler lights a cigarette.)</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh, hey, don&rsquo;t do that! Cut it out!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&rsquo;s worse than the thumb!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, this is so unfair!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, why is it unfair?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey&rsquo;s constant knuckle-cracking isn&rsquo;t annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? &hellip;I accept all those flaws, why can&rsquo;t you accept me for this?</p>
<p>(An awkward silence ensues.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &hellip;Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I-I could live without it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?</p>
<p>(Phoebe spits out her hair.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, now, don&rsquo;t listen to him, Pheebs, I think it&rsquo;s endearing.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, (Imitating Ross) &ldquo;you do, do you&rdquo;?</p>
<p>(Monica laughs and snorts.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You know, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with speaking correctly.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> &ldquo;Indeed there isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&hellip; I should really get back to work.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, &rsquo;cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.</p>
<p>(They degenerate into bickering and Chandler happily starts to smoke, undisturbed.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Iridium, Monica and Paula are working.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?</p>
<p><b>Paula:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.. Well, I&rsquo;m going out with a guy my friends all really like.</p>
<p><b>Paula:</b> Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Can you believe it? &hellip;Y&rsquo;know what? I just don&rsquo;t feel <i>the thing</i>. I mean, they feel the thing, I don&rsquo;t feel the thing.</p>
<p><b>Paula:</b> Honey.. you should always feel <i>the thing</i>. Listen, if that&rsquo;s how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.. it&rsquo;s gonna be really hard.</p>
<p><b>Paula:</b> Well, he&rsquo;s a big boy, he&rsquo;ll get over it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, he&rsquo;ll be fine. It&rsquo;s the other five I&rsquo;m worried about.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Cental Perk, Joey and Ross are persecuting Chandler about his smoking.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Do you have any respect for your body?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Don&rsquo;t you realise what you&rsquo;re-you&rsquo;re doing to yourself?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, y&rsquo;know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It&rsquo;s Alan, he wants to speak to you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what&rsquo;s up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it&rsquo;s not that big- ..well, that&rsquo;s true,.. Gee, y&rsquo;know, no-one- no-one&rsquo;s ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> If only he were a woman.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p>(They give each other a dubious look.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, everyond except Monica and Joey is watching Lambchop.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it&rsquo;d be talking too.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. I think it&rsquo;s time to change somebody&rsquo;s nicotine patch. (Does so.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey. Where&rsquo;s Joey?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I think he&rsquo;s across the hall.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (finishing changing Chandler&rsquo;s nicotine patch) There y&rsquo;go.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (deadpan) Ooh, I&rsquo;m alive with pleasure now.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I might!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sorry. ..Y&rsquo;know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> You&rsquo;re kidding. Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. &hellip;What is up with the universe?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nothing. I just think it&rsquo;s nice when we&rsquo;re all here together.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, Joey..</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (turns off the TV) Okay..</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh! That was Lambchop!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Please, guys, we have to talk.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait, wait, I&rsquo;m getting a <i>deja vu</i>&hellip;no, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Alright, we have to talk.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> There it is!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. It&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s about Alan. There&rsquo;s something that you should know. I mean, there&rsquo;s really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I&rsquo;ve decided to break up with Alan.</p>
<p>(They all gasp and clutch each other.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Is there somebody else?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, nononono.. it&rsquo;s just.. things change. People change.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> We didn&rsquo;t change..</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So that&rsquo;s it? It&rsquo;s over? Just like that?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, I- I could go on pretending-</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> -but that wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to me, it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to Alan- It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Who-who wants fair? Y&rsquo;know, I just want things back. Y&rsquo;know, the way they were.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry..</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastic) Oh, she&rsquo;s sorry! I feel better!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (tearful) I just can&rsquo;t believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;ll meet somone else. There&rsquo;ll be other Alans.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh, yeah! Right!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you guys gonna be okay?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey hey, we&rsquo;ll be fine. We&rsquo;re just gonna need a little time.</p>
