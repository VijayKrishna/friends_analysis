<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Street: Monica and Phoebe are walking to a newsstand.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Do you think they have yesterday&rsquo;s daily news?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don&rsquo;t look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> He&rsquo;s coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.</p>
<p>(The guy walks past them)</p>
<p><b>Guy:</b> Nice hat.</p>
<p><b>Monica and Phoebe:</b> (in unison) Thanks.</p>
<p>(The guy walks on)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We should do something. Whistle.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We are not going to whistle.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on, do it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Do it!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Do it do it do it!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!</p>
<p>(The guy turns round, startled. Monica points to Phoebe. The guy gets hit by a truck)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you did that!</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Hospital, the guy is in a coma and Mon and Pheebs are visiting.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why did I &lsquo;woo-hoo&rsquo;? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he&rsquo;d turn round and say &lsquo;I love that sound, I must have you now&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, what are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe nobody&rsquo;s tried this.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I wish we at least knew his name&hellip; Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he&rsquo;s a lawyer.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he&rsquo;s artistic.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, he&rsquo;s a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! And, he&rsquo;s the kinda guy who, when you&rsquo;re talking, he&rsquo;s listening, y&rsquo;know, and not saying &lsquo;Yeah, I understand&rsquo; but really wondering what you look like naked.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I wish all guys could be like him.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica and Phoebe are telling everyone about their coma guy.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> He doesn&rsquo;t have anyone.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you said woowoo. I don&rsquo;t even say woowoo.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, she&rsquo;s coming up! She&rsquo;s coming up! (Turns on the TV)</p>
<p><b>Jay Leno:</b> (on TV) Folks, when we come back we&rsquo;ll be talking about her new book, &lsquo;Euphoria Unbound&rsquo;: the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.</p>
<p>(Everyone has settled down to watch, except Chandler)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know, we don&rsquo;t have to watch this. <em>Weekend At Bernie&rsquo;s</em> is on <em>Showtime</em>, <em>HBO</em>, and <em>Cinemax</em>.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No way, forget it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> C&rsquo;mon, she&rsquo;s your mom!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Exactly. <em>Weekend At Bernie&rsquo;s</em>! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom&rsquo;s books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, you wouldn&rsquo;t think it was cool if you&rsquo;re eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of &rsquo;mistress Bitch.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> C&rsquo;mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she&rsquo;s a blast.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can say that because she&rsquo;s not your mom.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, please&hellip;</p>
<p>(Rachel opens the door to Paolo)</p>
<p><b>Paolo:</b> Bona sera.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Last night.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, so then his plane didn&rsquo;t explode in a big ball of fire?&hellip; Just a dream I had- but, phew.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey hey hey! She&rsquo;s on!</p>
<p><b>Paolo:</b> Ah! Nora Bing!</p>
<p><b>Jay Leno:</b> (on TV) &hellip;Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Your mom was arrested?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Shhh, busy beaming with pride.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (on TV) &hellip;This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I&rsquo;ve been intimate with a man&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Now why would she say that&rsquo;s embarrassing?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Shhh.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (on TV) &hellip;I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> THAT&rsquo;s TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!</p>
<p><b>Jay Leno:</b> (on TV) Alright, so now you&rsquo;re doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (on TV) Oh, fine. I&rsquo;m leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love&hellip;</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Awww!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.</p>
<p><b>Jay Leno:</b> (on TV) Y&rsquo;know, don&rsquo;t take this wrong, I-I just don&rsquo;t see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don&rsquo;t mean that, I don&rsquo;t mean that bad&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.</p>
<p>(The gang turn to look at Chandler)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;And then he burst into flames.</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: The Hospital, it&rsquo;s a montage of Monica and Phoebe&rsquo;s visit to the hospital with <em>My Guy</em> playing in the background. It starts with Monica reading a newspaper to him.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Let&rsquo;s see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill&hellip; the mayor wants to raise subway fares again&hellip; the high today was forty-five&hellip; and- oh, teams played sports.</p>
<p>[Next is a shot of them dragging an enormous plant into the room, then Monica knitting a sweater, then Phoebe singing, then Phoebe shaving him and chatting to Monica]</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What about Glen? He could be a Glen.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nah&hellip; not-not special enough.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! How about Agamemnon?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Waaay too special.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Mexican Restaurant, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and his mom are there.</h3>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> I am famished. What do I want&hellip; (Looks at Chandler&rsquo;s menu)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Please God don&rsquo;t let it be Kung Pow Chicken.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oh, you watched the show! What&rsquo;d you think?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could&rsquo;ve picked this place.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oooh, c&rsquo;mon, shut up, it&rsquo;s fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down) Well, I think we&rsquo;re ready for some tequila.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know I am.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Who&rsquo;s doing shots?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> There y&rsquo;go. Ross?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, I&rsquo;m not really a shot drinking kinda guy.</p>
<p>(Enter Rachel and Paolo. They are both somewhat flustered)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Sorry- sorry we&rsquo;re late, we, uh, kinda just, y&rsquo;know, lost track of time.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &hellip;But a man can change. (Downs a shot)</p>
<p>[Time lapse. Ross is now clearly drunk. He is holding up a shot glass to his eye like a jeweller&rsquo;s eye.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Anyone want me to appraise anything?</p>
<p>(Rachel feeds something to Paolo. He eats it and licks her hand)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I&rsquo;ve read everything you&rsquo;ve ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>[Cut to Mrs. Bing on the telephone.]</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Yeah, any messages for room 226?</p>
<p>(Ross emerges from a toilet marked &lsquo;Chicas&rsquo;)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> You okay there, slugger?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> What is with you tonight?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (To phone) Okay, thank you. (To Ross) It&rsquo;s the Italian Hand-Licker, isn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No. It&rsquo;s the one he&rsquo;s licking.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> She&rsquo;s supposed to be with you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y&rsquo;know why?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C&rsquo;mon, the guy&rsquo;s a secondary character, a, y&rsquo;know, complication you eventually kill off.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> When?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> He&rsquo;s not a hero. &hellip;You know who our hero is.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> No, it&rsquo;s you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Please.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> No, really, c&rsquo;mon. You&rsquo;re smart, you&rsquo;re sexy&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> You are gonna be fine, believe me.</p>
<p>(She kisses him on the cheek)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-oh&hellip;</p>
<p>(&hellip;Then full on the mouth)</p>
<p>(Enter Joey)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhhhh&hellip; I&rsquo;ll just pee in the street.</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, the next morning. Joey is getting the door in his dressing gown&mdash;it&rsquo;s Ross.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, is Chandler here?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p>(Ross drags Joey into the hall and slams the door)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn&rsquo;t tell&hellip; (Joey shakes his head) Okay, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m thinking- we don&rsquo;t need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Right. No big deal.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What code?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You don&rsquo;t kiss your friend&rsquo;s mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin&rsquo; aunt&hellip; but not a mom, never a mom!</p>
<p>(Chandler opens the door and startles them. He picks up the paper)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you guys doing out here?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well, you don&rsquo;t have your racket.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no I don&rsquo;t, because it&rsquo;s being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, well you didn&rsquo;t call and leave your grip size.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I&rsquo;m scum, I&rsquo;m scum.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ross, how could you let this happen?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, God, I&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;s a regular mom, y&rsquo;know? She&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s sexy, she&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You don&rsquo;t think my mom&rsquo;s sexy?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well&hellip; not in the same way&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;ll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it&rsquo;s easy giving birth to seven children?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I think we&rsquo;re getting into a weird area here&hellip;</p>
<p>(Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s door opens and Rachel and Paolo emerge)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&rsquo;re you guys doing out here?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, not playing raquetball!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> He forgot to leave his grip size!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He didn&rsquo;t get the goggles!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well,sounds like you two have issues.</p>
<p>(She and Paolo walk a little way down the hall)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Goodbye, baby.</p>
<p><b>Paolo:</b> Ciao, bela.</p>
<p>(They kiss. Ross is watching them)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Do they wait for me to do this?</p>
<p>(Joey and Ross go into Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So are you gonna tell him?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why would I tell him?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> How about &rsquo;cause if you don&rsquo;t, his mother might.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (Entering) What are you guys doing here?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhhhh&hellip; he&rsquo;s not even wearing a jockstrap!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &hellip;What did I ask?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Hospital. Phoebe is there stroking Coma Guy&rsquo;s hair, when Monica enters with a bunch of balloons.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing here?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nothing, I just thought I&rsquo;d stop by.. y&rsquo;know, after the uh&hellip; that I.. y&rsquo;know, so what are you doing here?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m not really here. Just thought I&rsquo;d drop these off&hellip;on the way.. my way&hellip; Do you come here a lot? Without me?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy&rsquo;s hair in the other direction) No! No! &hellip;So, um, do you think he&rsquo;s doing any better than he was this morning?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How would I know? I-I wasn&rsquo;t here.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Ross is talking to Chandler. Joey is making a snack at the bar.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re my friend. I-I had to tell you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, um, I don&rsquo;t know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he&rsquo;s drun..uh&hellip; (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I can&rsquo;t do this, I did it, it was me, I&rsquo;m sorry, I kissed your mom.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y&rsquo;know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Joey) You knew about this?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh&hellip; y&rsquo;know, knowledge is a tricky thing.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I spent the entire day with you, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, hey, hey, you&rsquo;re lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks, man, big help.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Ross) I can&rsquo;t believe this! What the hell were you thinking?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I wasn&rsquo;t- I mean, I-</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know-</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler-</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Me neither, y&rsquo;know what-</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m still mad at you for not telling me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What are you mad at me for?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler-</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn&rsquo;t kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See what happens when you break the code?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Joey-</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, everyone is there except for Chandler. Rachel is writing something and Monica walks up.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (Reading) &lsquo;A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Thought I&rsquo;d give it a shot. I&rsquo;m still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his &lsquo;love stick can be liberated from its denim prison&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (Reads) Yeah, I&rsquo;d say so. And there&rsquo;s no &lsquo;j&rsquo; in &lsquo;engorged&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hello.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Going to the hospital tonight?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, you?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, you?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You just asked me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can we do this now?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here&rsquo;s a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she&rsquo;s not a knockout.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I cannot believe we&rsquo;re having this conversation.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> C&rsquo;mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thanks. Hi, um, &rsquo;kay. I&rsquo;d like to start with a song that&rsquo;s about a man that I recently met, who&rsquo;s, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look) &rsquo;kay. (Sung:)</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>You don&rsquo;t have to be awake to be my man,<br>
 As long as you have brainwaves I&rsquo;ll be there to hold your hand.<br>
 Though we just met the other day, <br>
 There&rsquo;s something I have got to say&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(She sees Monica sneaking out) Okay, thank you very much, I&rsquo;m gonna take a short break! (Runs out, knocking over the mike stand)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!</p>
<p>(Enter Chandler)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What was that?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (Laughing) Mother-Kisser&hellip; (Sees Ross&rsquo;s look) I&rsquo;ll shut up.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you&rsquo;re still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She&rsquo;s always been a Freudian nightmare.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don&rsquo;t you say something?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because it&rsquo;s complicated, it&rsquo;s complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!</p>
<p>(People turn to look)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (To the rest of Central Perk) We&rsquo;re rehearsing a Greek play.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s very funny. We done now?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No! Okay, you mean, you&rsquo;re not gonna talk to her, you&rsquo;re not gonna tell her how you feel?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn&rsquo;t mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can&rsquo;t talk to her.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, &lsquo;you&rsquo; can&rsquo;t, or (Points to Chandler) you can&rsquo;t? (Chandler grabs his finger) Okay, that&rsquo;s my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee) That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Coma Guy&rsquo;s Room, Monica bursts in, closely followed by Phoebe. There is no sign of Coma Guy. His bed is empty.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Alright, whadyou do with him?</p>
<p>(There is the sound of a flushing toilet and Coma Guy emerges from the bathroom)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh! You&rsquo;re awake!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Look at you! How, how do you feel?</p>
<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You look good!</p>
<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> I feel good! &hellip;Who are you?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, sorry.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m Phoebe Buffay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m Monica Geller. I&rsquo;ve been taking care of you.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, we both have.</p>
<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, actually it&rsquo;s just from me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I got you the foot massager.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know who shaved you? That was me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I read to you.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I sang. (To Monica) Hah!</p>
<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> Well,&hellip; thanks.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, my pleasure.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> So. I guess I&rsquo;ll see you around.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What, that&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &ldquo;See you around?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> Well, what do you want me to say?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe, um, &ldquo;That was nice?&rdquo; Admit something to me? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Coma Guy:</b> Alright, I&rsquo;ll call you.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t think you mean that.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> This is so typical. Y&rsquo;know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s just, you wake up, and &ldquo;See you around!&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s go, Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s Chandler is talking with his mom.</h3>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Car&rsquo;s waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, just knowing you&rsquo;re gonna be there is enough.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You kissed my best Ross! &hellip;Or something to that effect.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> (Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really stupid.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Really stupid. And I don&rsquo;t even know how it happened. I&rsquo;m sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. No. No&hellip;</p>
<p>[Cut to the hallway, Joey is listening to Chandler and his mom&rsquo;s conversation through the door as Ross walks up.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re kidding.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no. He said &ldquo;When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Then she came back with &ldquo;The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> &rsquo;kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That makes more sense.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So, what&rsquo;s going on now?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I dunno, I&rsquo;ve been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to the door) I don&rsquo;t hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Whaddya see?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hard to tell, they&rsquo;re so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They&rsquo;re walking away&hellip; they&rsquo;re walking away&hellip; No, no they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re coming right at us! Run! Run!</p>
<p>(Joey runs off down the hall. Ross tries Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment, but it is locked so he has to stand in the hall and pretend he wasn&rsquo;t listening. Chandler and his mom come out)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> You okay, kiddo?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Alright. (Kisses him)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nice save.</p>
<p>(She walks down the hall)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bing:</b> Mr. Geller.</p>
<p>(She leaves)</p>
<p>(Ross knocks on Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s door)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You mean that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? How&rsquo;d it go?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Awful. Awful. Couldn&rsquo;ta gone worse.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, howdya feel?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pretty good! I told her.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, see? So, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t such a bad idea, y&rsquo;know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don&rsquo;t have to go down that road.</p>

<h2>Closing Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is handing out copies of her book to the gang.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he&rsquo;s not &rsquo;reaching for her heaving beasts&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What&rsquo;s a &lsquo;niffle&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You usually find them on the &lsquo;heaving beasts&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Alright, alright, so I&rsquo;m not a great typist&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait, did you get to the part about his &lsquo;huge throbbing pens&rsquo;? Tell ya, you don&rsquo;t wanna be around when he starts writing with those!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Alright, that&rsquo;s it! Give it back! That&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Nooo!</p>
