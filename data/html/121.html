<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, everyone is looking at papers.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I have no idea. But look how much they spent!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know. It&rsquo;s just such reckless spending.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I think when someone steals your credit card, they&rsquo;ve kind of already thrown caution to the wind.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! The yuk! Ross, he&rsquo;s doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel&rsquo;s room) come here, Marcel-</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no, not in my room! I&rsquo;ll get him.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, you&rsquo;ve got to do something about the humping.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What? It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just a phase.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that&rsquo;s what we said about Joey&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Would you all relax? It&rsquo;s not that big a deal.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Let&rsquo;s just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel emerges from her room.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> This woman&rsquo;s living my life.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> She&rsquo;s living my life, and she&rsquo;s doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I&rsquo;m intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You&rsquo;re not an artist.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Monica, c&rsquo;mon, you do cool things.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh really? Okay, let&rsquo;s compare, shall we.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Yawning) Oh, it&rsquo;s so late for &rsquo;shall we&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Yawning) Nooo&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> This is so unfair! She&rsquo;s got everything I want, and she doesn&rsquo;t have my mother.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> How about Joey&hellip; Pepponi?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that&rsquo;s more neutral.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey&hellip; Switzerland?</p>
<p>(The waitress brings their coffee.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Plus, y&rsquo;know, I think it should be Joe. Y&rsquo;know, Joey makes me sound like I&rsquo;m, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joe&hellip;Joe&hellip;Joe&hellip;Stalin?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Stalin&hellip;Stalin&hellip;do I know that name? It sounds familiar.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, it does not ring a bell with me&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y&rsquo;know, that&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Might wanna try Joseph.</p>
<p>(Joey visibly thinks &lsquo;Of course!&rsquo; and writes it down.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Joseph Stalin. I think you&rsquo;d remember that!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I&rsquo;m taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I&rsquo;m going to tap class.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> This woman&rsquo;s got my life, I should get to see who she is.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Go to the post office! I&rsquo;m sure her picture&rsquo;s up! &hellip;Okay, Monica, y&rsquo;know what, honey, you&rsquo;re kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is madness. It&rsquo;s madness, I tell you, <b>for the love of God, Monica, don&rsquo;t do it</b>!! &hellip;Thank you.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What d&rsquo;you think?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Lotsa things.</p>
<p>(They go in and sit down.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Which one do you think she is?</p>
<p>(The teacher comes up to them.)</p>
<p><b>Teacher:</b> May I help you?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, no thanks, we&rsquo;re just here to observe.</p>
<p><b>Teacher:</b> You don&rsquo;t observe a dance class. You <b>dance</b> a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What does she mean?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think she means (Imitates) &lsquo;You <b>dance</b> a dance class&rsquo;. Oh, c&rsquo;mon, c&rsquo;mon. (They put on some spare shoes)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, d&rsquo;y&rsquo;see anybody you think could be me?</p>
<p><b>Teacher:</b> (To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let&rsquo;s not have that happen again!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> She could be you.</p>
<p>(Music starts)</p>
<p><b>Teacher:</b> Let&rsquo;s get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight&hellip;</p>
<p>(Everyone starts to dance in unison. Monica flounders)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I&rsquo;m not getting this!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I&rsquo;m totally getting it!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?</p>
<p>(Rachel taps into view; she is in perfect sync with the rest of the class)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? You just click when they click.</p>
<p><b>Teacher:</b> Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.</p>
<p>(The girls are unsure how to pair off. Phoebe settles it)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I&rsquo;m with Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Great. It&rsquo;s gym class all over again.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe and</b> <b>Rachel:</b> Aww.</p>
<p><b>Teacher:</b> Well that&rsquo;s all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why don&rsquo;t I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.</p>
<p>(She starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. The teacher grabs her hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in)</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> It&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;m here. Sorry I&rsquo;m late, okay, here I am. Who&rsquo;s the new tense girl?</p>
<p><b>Teacher:</b> She&rsquo;s your partner.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> Hi. I&rsquo;m Monica.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh. Monica! &hellip;Hi. I&rsquo;m Mo- &hellip;nana.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> (Fake Monica) Monana?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah. It&rsquo;s Dutch.</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> You&rsquo;re kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.</p>
<p><b>Teacher:</b> And we&rsquo;re dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight&hellip;</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross is entering.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (Mortified) Hi.</p>
<p><b>Chandler and</b> <b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Where&rsquo;ve you been?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> At the vet.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> She&rsquo;s not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She says Marcel&rsquo;s humping thing&rsquo;s not a phase. Apparently he&rsquo;s reached sexual maturity.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She says as time goes on, he&rsquo;s gonna start getting agressive and violent.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So what does this mean?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m gonna have to give him up.</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, scene continued from earlier. They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe it, Ross. This sucks!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know. I know. I mean, one day, he&rsquo;s this little thing, and before you know it, he&rsquo;s this little thing I can&rsquo;t get off my leg.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Isn&rsquo;t there any way you can keep him?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no. The vet says unless he&rsquo;s in a place where he has regular access to some&hellip; monkey lovin,&rsquo; he&rsquo;s just gonna get vicious. I&rsquo;ve just gotta get him into a zoo.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> How do you get a monkey into a zoo?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know that one! &hellip;No, that&rsquo;s Popes into a <em>Volkswagen</em>.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, we&rsquo;re applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y&rsquo;know, like, uh, San Diego&hellip; right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y&rsquo;know, he&rsquo;s out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, but that&rsquo;s like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it&rsquo;s a total party zoo.</p>
<p>(Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel enters.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey. We found her, we found the girl.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Did you call the cops?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Nope. We took her to lunch.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She&rsquo;s a stealer.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know what? After you&rsquo;re with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;Take off their hats!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Popes in a <em>Volkswagen</em>! &hellip;I love that joke.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No way. No way did you do this.</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Monana was very brave.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> So once they caught on to the fact that we&rsquo;re, y&rsquo;know, short and have breasts&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &hellip;They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t wait up. (Exits)</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Oh, by the way, tomorrow we&rsquo;re auditioning for a Broadway show.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &rsquo;scuse me?</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> There&rsquo;s an open call for Cats. I&rsquo;m thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nononononono. Think who you&rsquo;re dealing with here. I mean, I&rsquo;m not like you. I-I can&rsquo;t even stand in front of a tap class.</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Well, that&rsquo;s just probably &rsquo;cause of your Amish background.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Well, you&rsquo;re Pennsylvania Dutch, right?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see <em>Dead Poets&rsquo; Society</em>?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> I thought that movie was so incredibly&hellip; <b>boring</b>. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can&rsquo;t be in the play? What was that?! It&rsquo;s like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, &lsquo;Now, that&rsquo;s two hours of my life that I&rsquo;m never getting back.&rsquo; And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em>.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, tiem lapse. Everyone but Joey and Monica are there.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn&rsquo;t get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don&rsquo;t know who this is harder on, me or him.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;d say that chair&rsquo;s taking the brunt.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, somebody will.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) You know there already <b>is</b> a Joseph Stalin?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re kidding.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You&rsquo;d think you would&rsquo;ve known that!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know, you&rsquo;d think I would&rsquo;ve.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &hellip;Flame Boy.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Where exactly is your zoo?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Well, it&rsquo;s technically not a zoo per se, it&rsquo;s more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Does he, uh, fight with other animals?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s very docile.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Even if he were&hellip; cornered?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I, I don&rsquo;t know. Why?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Uh, how is he at handling small objects?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He can hold a banana, if that&rsquo;s whatcha mean&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> How about a hammer, or a small blade?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why- why- why would he need a blade?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> Well, if he&rsquo;s up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you&rsquo;ve got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it&rsquo;s just cruel.</p>
<p>(Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel)</p>
<p><b>Chandler and</b> <b>Joey:</b> He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;He&rsquo;s in.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He&rsquo;s in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!</p>
<p><b>Dr. Baldhara:</b> You&rsquo;re making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego&rsquo;s all well and good, but if you give him to me, I&rsquo;ll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is dusting. She comes to the table, lifts all the magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in, obviously drunk.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yo- hooo!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Where the hell&rsquo;ve you been?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Are you drunk?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I&rsquo;m lying. I am so drunk.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y&rsquo;know what, you could&rsquo;ve called, I have been up here, I&rsquo;ve been worried&hellip;</p>
<p>(Monica is drinking from the tap)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica? Monica!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Water rules!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you&rsquo;re gonna be showing up for work?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nope. Going to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em> today.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay Monica, what are you doing? You&rsquo;re gonna lose your job! This is not you!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, it is me! Y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;m not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y&rsquo;know, when I&rsquo;m with her, I am so much more than that. I&rsquo;m- I&rsquo;m Monana!</p>
<p>(The phone rings and Rachel answers)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it&rsquo;s for you, the credit card people.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> They&rsquo;ve arrested Monica.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> New York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How are you?</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m not too bad. Fortunately, blue&rsquo;s my colour. How-how did you know I was here?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Because&hellip; I&rsquo;m Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> That I was not expecting.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I want you to know, it wasn&rsquo;t me who turned you in.</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Oh. Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn&rsquo;t for you, I would never have gotten to sing <em>Memories</em> on the stage at the <em>Wintergarden Theater</em>!</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Well, actually, you only got to sing &rsquo;memo-&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I just can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who&rsquo;s gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who&rsquo;s gonna take me to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em>?</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you&rsquo;re worried about who&rsquo;s gonna take you to the <em>Big Apple Circus</em>?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, not&hellip; worried, just&hellip; wondering.</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> There&rsquo;s nothing to wonder about, Monica. You&rsquo;re gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that&rsquo;s who you are.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Not necessarily&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it&rsquo;s the Amish thing.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Um, I&rsquo;m not actually Amish.</p>
<p><b>Fake Monica:</b> Really? Then why are you like that?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Tap Class, Monica is standing by the door.</h3>
<p><b>Teacher:</b> You by the door. In or out?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)</p>
<p><b>Teacher:</b> You in the back, you&rsquo;re getting it all wrong!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but at least I&rsquo;m doing it!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel.</h3>
<p><b>PA:</b> This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don&rsquo;t eat it &rsquo;till you get on the plane.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there&rsquo;s also a lot to learn.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it&rsquo;s a monkey.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Just, just say what you feel.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Marcel, I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That was good.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It&rsquo;s, uh, just, y&rsquo;know, something to, um, do on the plane.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, if you guys don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d like to take a moment, just me and him.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. (They just stand there, then realise what he means and go to the other end of the room)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Marcel, c&rsquo;mere, c&rsquo;mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There&rsquo;s just a coupla things I want to say. I&rsquo;m really gonna miss you, and I&rsquo;m never gonna forget about you. You&rsquo;ve been more than just a pet to me, you&rsquo;ve been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.</p>
<p>(Marcel is put in a cage and taken away.)</p>
