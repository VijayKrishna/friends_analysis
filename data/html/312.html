<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is getting ready for her first day.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, but don&rsquo;t worry. I don&rsquo;t think anybody&rsquo;s gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Ross) Tell him.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Chandler) It&rsquo;s her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y&rsquo;know he&rsquo;s the botanist.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh God. Y&rsquo;know, botanists are such geeks.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach, I&rsquo;m here with the purses!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don&rsquo;t need that today.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Honey, just relax, it&rsquo;s gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don&rsquo;t I come down there and I&rsquo;ll take you out to lunch?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh honey, thank you, but Mark&rsquo;s taking me out.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s kinda like a &lsquo;good luck on your first day&rsquo; sort of thing. (to Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, no, it&rsquo;s a purse. And there&rsquo;s a thermos in it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well apparently Albert has no friends. He&rsquo;s very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he&rsquo;s getting married is so he can see a stripper.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don&rsquo;t you get a magician?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What, what, what?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) &rsquo;my vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I&rsquo;ve touched you, you seem emptier still.&rsquo; He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You really think that is what he meant?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey&rsquo;s dance audition, Joey is warming up.</h3>
<p><b>Director:</b> Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he&rsquo;s having a relationship crisis and can&rsquo;t get out of Long Island.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So, does that mean the audition is off?</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> Listen Joey, seeing as you&rsquo;ve got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> Aw come on Joey, it&rsquo;s easy. Y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s hand, hand, head, head, (very quickly, Joey watches stunned) up, out a beret, out a beret, big turn here, grand dechant, desont, desont, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What are you wrapping?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s a vase.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, just like the one in the poem.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well not exactly like the one in the poem.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What do you mean?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Moondance Diner.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Julio) So! I&rsquo;m just an empty vase, huh?</p>
<p><b>Julio:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know, so I don&rsquo;t read as many important books as you do, and I don&rsquo;t write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y&rsquo;know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my <i>People</i> magazine comes on Saturday, and the new <i>Hold Everything</i> catalog. Y&rsquo;know but that does not mean that I&rsquo;m empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.</p>
<p><b>Julio:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You don&rsquo;t even know me&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Julio:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Julio:</b> The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, my friend Phoebe&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Julio:</b> No, it&rsquo;s about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (sarcastically) Oh yeah.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey&rsquo;s audition, the director has returned and wants to see the combination.</h3>
<p><b>Director:</b> All right, let&rsquo;s do it!</p>
<p>(The group does the same horrible dance that Joey did earlier in the show, except they&rsquo;re all out of sync and they do the jazz hands at the end.)</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> No, no, no. What was that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I know, it was the best I could get out of them.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> Well, people!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> People, people, people.</p>
<p><b>Director:</b> Let&rsquo;s try it again, and this time let&rsquo;s watch everybody watch Joey. (to Joey) Show &rsquo;em how it&rsquo;s done. (to the pianist) Count it off.</p>
<p>(The pianist starts to play, and Joey readies himself, and then runs out of the audition.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler and Rachel are there.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See, she&rsquo;s fully dressed, right?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And then you click it and, uh-oh, she&rsquo;s naked. And then, and then you click it again and she&rsquo;s dressed. She&rsquo;s a business woman, she&rsquo;s walking down the street, she&rsquo;s window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she&rsquo;s naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know what, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m gonna spend some alone time with the pen.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (sits down next to her) I&rsquo;m sorry, I was an idiot.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> A big idiot.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.</p>
<p>(Gunther is eavesdropping in the background.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, why is it hard, I mean we&rsquo;ve been together for almost a year now?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it&rsquo;s possible I think I love you even more. So, it&rsquo;s hard for me to believe that I&rsquo;m not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Let it be me! Let it be me!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, that&rsquo;s very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there&rsquo;s no reason to be jealous. (she kisses him)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Where ya going?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;ve got to go pick up Ben, we&rsquo;ve got a play date this afternoon.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, with who?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> There was a woman at the&hellip; (realizes) The stripper?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You have a play date with a stripper?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y&rsquo;know, did her thing. And it turns out she&rsquo;s got a boy about Ben&rsquo;s age, so we&rsquo;re taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure, is she married?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ahh, no.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you jealous?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noo, I y&rsquo;know I don&rsquo;t see why she has to play with you, that&rsquo;s all. I mean doesn&rsquo;t she have any y&rsquo;know other stripper moms friends of her own?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You are totally jealous.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y&rsquo;know about strippers. And y&rsquo;know, and um, I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Honey, I love you too.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p>(She runs over and gives him a very passionate kiss.)</p>
