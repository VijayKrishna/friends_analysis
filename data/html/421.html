<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are sitting and talking.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I know. <b>Ross</b> is getting married.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe is, making people.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Everybody&rsquo;s doing stuff!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, not something stupid, something huge.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why not?! I mean it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just climbing! It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just steep!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We&rsquo;re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What-what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We&rsquo;re gonna climb Mt. Everest!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah baby!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y&rsquo;know you can die. And, you would die!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (dejected) Yeah, well&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We could get that Everest video though.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we could do that without y&rsquo;know risking our lives at all!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> And while we&rsquo;re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? <i>Die Hard</i>! (Chandler&rsquo;s excited.) Oh, y&rsquo;know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (dejected) Oh, well&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So you guys&rsquo;ll stay here and hang out with me?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeeeeahhhh.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> But I&rsquo;ll tell you something. One of these days we&rsquo;re get off of our buts and rent <i>Die Hard</i> again!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah we are!</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross&rsquo;s apartment, he and Emily are addressing their invitations.</h3>
<p><b>Emily:</b> So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he&rsquo;s so cheap, he&rsquo;d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her some envelopes.)</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Yeah, they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> If anyone asks, we&rsquo;ll just say Ben addressed them. (Looking through the envelopes.) Oh! So you invited Rachel then?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure. Why not?</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t invite her?</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh, no-no, y&rsquo;know I absolutely adore Rachel it&rsquo;s just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it&rsquo;s absolutely your decision. (Gets up.) More tea?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> You did! Oh&hellip; I always figured you just thought I was Monica&rsquo;s geeky older brother.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I did.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> &hellip;the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you&rsquo;ve grown. Y&rsquo;know? I mean my Mom <b>never</b> thought this would work out. It was all, &ldquo;Once a cheater, always a cheater.&rdquo; Ooh, I just wish we hadn&rsquo;t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica&rsquo;s photo albums, I mean you don&rsquo;t do that if you&rsquo;re just in it for two weeks.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You think?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you&rsquo;re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, you&rsquo;re right.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didn&rsquo;t know that, but you should see your faces.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey guys! What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We&rsquo;re hanging out.</p>
<p>(Rachel starts going through her mail, and come across her invitation.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&rsquo;s this? Is this Ross&rsquo;s wedding invitation?</p>

<h2>Closing Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are reading a book about things to do whilst in London.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there&rsquo;s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost as good as being there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s better! You can&rsquo;t go to a museum in your underwear!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, You could, but&hellip; probably just the one time.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room&hellip; we&rsquo;d never even have to go outside!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!</p>
