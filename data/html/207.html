<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment. Everyone is sitting at the couches, Chandler enters.</h3>
<p>Chandler: Okay, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something&hellip; repellent&hellip; about me?</p>
<p>Rachel: So, how was the party?</p>
<p>Chandler: Well it couldn&rsquo;t have been worse. A woman literally passed <b>through</b> me. Okay, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?</p>
<p>Phoebe: No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everything.</p>
<p>Chandler: Woah, woah, I&rsquo;ve put on a little weight?</p>
<p>Phoebe: No, not weight&hellip; y&rsquo;know, more like insulation.</p>
<p>Monica: Chandler, I&rsquo;m unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.</p>
<p>Chandler: Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.</p>
<p>Monica: Please.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> C&rsquo;mon. Let her. Yeah.</p>
<p>Chandler: All right, Okay, all right. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; home.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Your boobs are fine. look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. (hugs Chandler but holds her hands apart behind his back) Oh, can&rsquo;t make&hellip; hands&hellip; meet&hellip;</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Hallway, Chandler comes out wearing spandex, jogging in place. Monica is there.</h3>
<p>Chandler: Okay, let&rsquo;s do it. (Monica looks at him funny) What?</p>
<p>Monica: Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.</p>
<p>Chandler: And we&rsquo;re changing. (jogs back in his apartment)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch. Rachel is working.</h3>
<p>Chandler: (slowly lifts coffee cup to his mouth) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. (slowly sets the cup back down) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. (Joey intercepts the cup and puts it down for him). She&rsquo;s insane, the woman is insane. It&rsquo;s before work, it&rsquo;s after work, it&rsquo;s during work. She&rsquo;s got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won&rsquo;t bring me my mail anymore.</p>
<p>(Phoebe enters.)</p>
<p>Rachel: Hey Pheebs, how&rsquo;d it go with Scott last night?</p>

<p>Phoebe: look, I, y&rsquo;know, I don&rsquo;t mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y&rsquo;know he&rsquo;s really interesting and he&rsquo;s really sweet and why won&rsquo;t he give it up?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe he, uhh&hellip; drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.</p>
<p>Phoebe: No, whad&rsquo;ya mean? He&rsquo;s not British.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Maybe he&rsquo;s&hellip; gay.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Oohh, um, no, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the problem. &rsquo;Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like&hellip; definitely felt something.</p>
<p>Rachel: Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?</p>
<p>Phoebe: No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.</p>

<p>Chandler: So you really Okay about all this?</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh yeah, c&rsquo;mon, I&rsquo;m movin&rsquo; on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.</p>

<p>Michael: I don&rsquo;t know if Monica told you but this is the first date I&rsquo;ve gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.</p>

<p>Michael: (confused) I&rsquo;m sorry?</p>
<p>Rachel: Cats, how long do they live figuring you don&rsquo;t&hellip; y&rsquo;know, throw &rsquo;em under a bus or something?</p>
<p>Michael: Um, maybe 15, 16 years.</p>
<p>Rachel: That&rsquo;s just great. (she picks up her champagne and starts drinking)</p>
<p>Michael: Um, cheers.</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, right, clink. (downs her glass)</p>
<p>Michael: Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, no, Michael, it&rsquo;s not you. I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s this thing. It&rsquo;s probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Michael: Oh, that does sound&hellip;Ahh.</p>
<p>Rachel: I mean he just started going out with her.</p>
<p>Michael: Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?</p>
<p>Rachel: Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, look at me. Okay, Michael, let&rsquo;s talk about you.</p>
<p>Michael: All right.</p>
<p>Rachel: Okay, Okay. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch.</h3>
<p>Phoebe: So, I figured it out.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p>Phoebe: Why Scott doesn&rsquo;t want to sleep with me. It&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m not sexy enough.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Phoebe, that&rsquo;s crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, &ldquo;Excellent butt, great rack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoebe: Really? That&rsquo;s so sweet. I mean, I&rsquo;m officially offended but, sweet.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Pheebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you&rsquo;re just gonna have to ask him.</p>
<p>Phoebe: You&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right. Ah, you are so yumm. (they hug)</p>
<p>(Outside the window, Monica and Chandler jog up. Monica playfully pushes him. They start pushing and slapping harder and harder until Monica pushes him down. Chandler stands up, with a serious expression, and chases her away.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Restaurant, Rachel pours the last of the champagne bottle in her glass.</h3>
<p>Rachel: (obviously drunk) I mean, it&rsquo;s a cat, y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s a <b>cat</b>. Why can&rsquo;t they get one of those bugs, y&rsquo;know, one of those fruit flies, those things that live for like a day or something? (belligerently) What&rsquo;re they called, what&rsquo;re they called, what&rsquo;re they called?</p>
<p>Michael: Fruit flies?</p>
<p>Rachel: Yes! Thank you.</p>
<p>(The waiter comes to the table.)</p>
<p>Waiter: So, would you like any dessert?</p>
<p>Michael: No! No dessert, just a check, please.</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, you&rsquo;re not having fun, are you?</p>
<p>Michael: No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I&rsquo;ve been playing the movie <i>Diner</i> in my head.</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, Look at me, Look at me. Oh, I&rsquo;m on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his&hellip; Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can&rsquo;t I do that?</p>
<p>Michael: Oy. Look, I&rsquo;ve been through a divorce, trust me you&rsquo;re gonna be fine. You just can&rsquo;t see it now because you haven&rsquo;t had any closure.</p>
<p>Rachel: Yeah! Closure. That&rsquo;s what it is, that&rsquo;s what I need. God, you&rsquo;re brilliant! Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that? How do I get that?</p>
<p>Michael: Well, you know, there&rsquo;s no one way really, it&rsquo;s just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m over you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel: Closure, that&rsquo;s what it is. Closure. (she Looks around the restaurant, spotting a guy with a cellular phone) Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel&mdash;woo (she almost falls out of her chair)</p>
<p>Guy: Hang on.</p>
<p>Rachel: Hello, excuse me.</p>
<p>Guy: What.</p>
<p>Rachel: Hi, I&rsquo;m sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.</p>
<p>Guy: I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Rachel: I can see that. I&mdash;just one phone call, I&rsquo;ll be very quick, I&rsquo;ll even pay for it myself. (man is still reluctant) Okay, you&rsquo;re bein&rsquo; a little weird about your phone.</p>
<p>Guy: All right, fine. (on the phone) I&rsquo;ll call you back. (hands the phone to her)</p>
<p>Rachel: Thank you. Okay. (dials) (to Michael) Machine. Just waiting for the beep.</p>
<p>Michael: Good.</p>
<p>Rachel: (on phone) Ross, hi, it&rsquo;s Rachel. I&rsquo;m just calling to say that um, everything&rsquo;s fine and I&rsquo;m really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I&rsquo;m thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> And what did he say?</p>
<p>Phoebe: He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y&rsquo;know, like, &lsquo;ohh, is he gonna call me the next day&rsquo; and, y&rsquo;know, &lsquo;where is this going&rsquo; and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Yeah, so I said, &ldquo;Okay, relax please,&rdquo; y&rsquo;know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that&rsquo;s fine too. So after a looooot of talking&hellip; I convinced him.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no it&rsquo;s not interesting. Okay, it&rsquo;s very, very not interesting. In fact it&rsquo;s actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.</p>
<p>Rachel: All right, I got it Ross.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.</p>
<p>Rachel: (hurt) What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.</p>
<p>Rachel: Hey, I was doin&rsquo; great before I found out about you. You think it&rsquo;s easy for me to see you with Julie?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Then you should have said something before I met her.</p>
<p>Rachel: I didn&rsquo;t know then. And how come you never said anything to me.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> There was never a good time.</p>
<p>Rachel: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Not, not, not <b>every night</b>. You know, and&hellip; and it&rsquo;s not like I didn&rsquo;t try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y&rsquo;know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiancés or, or, or Italian guys.</p>
<p>Rachel: Hey, there was one Italian guy, Okay, and do you even have a point?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> The point is I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t need this right now, Okay. It, it&rsquo;s too late, I&rsquo;m with somebody else, I&rsquo;m happy. This ship has sailed.</p>
<p>Rachel: Yeah, what&rsquo;re you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, I&rsquo;ve been doin&rsquo; it since the ninth grade, I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty damn good at it.</p>
<p>Rachel: All right, fine, you go ahead and you do that, all right Ross.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine.</p>
<p>Rachel: &rsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t need your stupid ship.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Good.</p>
<p>Rachel: Good. (Ross leaves)</p>
<p>(Rachel gets up and opens the door, yelling after him.)</p>
<p>Rachel: And ya know what, now I&rsquo;ve got closure.</p>
<p>(Rachel slams the door and locks it. She sits down, visibly upset. She puts her head in her hands and begins to cry. Ross comes back and is standing outside the window. When Rachel regroups and gets back up to finish closing, she sees him. She smiles. She goes to open the door and can&rsquo;t get the lock undone.)</p>
