<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow, for a guy who&rsquo;s recently lost his job, you&rsquo;re in an awfully good mood.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, I&rsquo;ll be alright. I mean it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on <i>Days of Our Lives</i>. Heh? I mean that&rsquo;s gotta have some kind of cache.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Cache? Jaunty?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I&rsquo;m gonna get some coffee.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah and oh, and but there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Men just take out wind?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like <i>The Hobbit</i>.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It is nothing like the Hobbit. It&rsquo;s like reading about every relationship I&rsquo;ve ever had, except for Richard.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s yummy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes. But all the other ones.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they&rsquo;re always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Anybody want a croan.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it&rsquo;s like, um, &lsquo;Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?&rsquo;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> No, can we get back to me?</p>
<p><b>Estelle:</b> Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for <i>Another World</i>.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Alright. Cab driver number two?</p>
<p><b>Estelle:</b> You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein&rsquo; a neurosurgeon to drivin&rsquo; a cab?</p>
<p><b>Estelle:</b> Things change, roll with em.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But this is a two line part, it&rsquo;s like takin&rsquo; a step backwards. I&rsquo;m not gonna do this.</p>
<p><b>Estelle:</b> Joey, I&rsquo;m gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don&rsquo;t make on the floor.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called &lsquo;Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel&rsquo;.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey you guys.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, sweetie we&rsquo;ve gotta go.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> NO!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Actually it&rsquo;s the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don&rsquo;t miss the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, see this isn&rsquo;t about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You go girl. I can&rsquo;t pull that off can I?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Excuse me, your, your, your wind?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won&rsquo;t let me blow?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You, you know I, I don&rsquo;t, have a- have a problem with that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> See, this is why I don&rsquo;t date women who read. Uh-oh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can&rsquo;t be good.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m gonna do.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on <i>Another World</i>.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That audition.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s a two line part.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well knock it off, you&rsquo;re supposed to be my friend.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I am your friend.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it&rsquo;s gonna be till you get another.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, I don&rsquo;t wanna hear this right now.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh, I&rsquo;m just saying&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well don&rsquo;t just say.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok. I&rsquo;ll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.</p>

<p><b>Casting Guy:</b> Five oh dollars.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh, you know what it is? It&rsquo;s smudgy &rsquo;cause they&rsquo;re fax pages. Now when I was on <i>Days of Our Lives</i> as Dr. Drake Remoray, they&rsquo;d send over the whole script on real paper and everything.</p>
<p><b>Casting Guy:</b> That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin&rsquo;, I could attend to the victims &rsquo;cause I have a background in medical acting.</p>
<p><b>Casting Guy:</b> Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No no, uh, don&rsquo;t thank me for comin&rsquo; in.

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you not remember the puppet guy?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And his puppet too.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah ok, well at least I didn&rsquo;t let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Not uh, not to my recollection.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c&rsquo;mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Only &rsquo;cause you took up half the circle.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Listen to you two. It&rsquo;s so sad. Looks like I&rsquo;m gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m gonna hold him a different way. Look I don&rsquo;t understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin&rsquo; over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.</p>
