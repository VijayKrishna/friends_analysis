<p><b>Monica:</b> Tell him.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Tell him, tell him.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Just&hellip;please tell him.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Shut up!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tell me what?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look at you, you won&rsquo;t even look at him.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won&rsquo;t look at me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Doing it on this table. (points at the table)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Exellent dream score.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why, why, why would you dream that?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> More importantly, was I any good?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, you were pretty damn good.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Interesting, cause in my dreams, I&rsquo;m allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I love it, when we share.</p>
<p>(Ross goes over to the counter. Chandler follows him.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You&rsquo;re okay there?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I can&rsquo;t belive you two had sex in her dream.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else&rsquo;s subconscious.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Get off.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (points at Joey&rsquo;s pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. What are you wearing?</p>
<p>(Chandler, Monica and Phoebe looks at him)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pirates again?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, nothing like that. I was just&hellip;such a dummie. I taught this &ldquo;massage-yourself-at-home-workshop.&rdquo; And they are.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What&hellip; I could, I could do it. What is it?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It&rsquo;s a whole big boob story.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I could be a secretary.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you know Phoebs. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I could do that.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. &lsquo;Help, come quick, they&rsquo;re still extinct.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it&rsquo;s for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Just a touch. Mon, I don&rsquo;t understand. I mean, you&rsquo;ve been dating this guy since like, what&hellip; his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so&hellip; Oh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Could tonight be the Night?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. Look he&rsquo;s a great guy and I love being with him but&hellip; you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don&rsquo;t plan these things.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, did you shave your legs?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> A-ha!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Services? (Ross looks at him) Oh, services.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s right, JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don&rsquo;t want me. Judging by his number, I&rsquo;d be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, hey. How was the first day?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I didn&rsquo;t tell anybody that I knew you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why not?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, because, you know&hellip; they don&rsquo;t like you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I thought you knew that.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Noho. Who doesn&rsquo;t they like me?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Everyone. Except for uh&hellip; no everyone.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you talking about?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Don&rsquo;t feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you&rsquo;re like &ldquo;Mr. Boss Man&rdquo;. You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, &ldquo;Boss Man Bing&rdquo;.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t sound like that.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, oh Chandler&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh&hellip; Yeah, you do.</p>

<p>(Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (reaches for hi scones) My scones.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica and Young Ethan are sitting in the couch.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Did not.</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How was that possible?</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Well, think about it. It&rsquo;s always on the news. &lsquo;A man is being held up, at gunpoint.&rsquo; &lsquo;Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.&rsquo; And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? (He checks his watch.) Oh, ah. I should go.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>
<p>(They kiss)</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Unless&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I&rsquo;m going to, so&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;d really like that.</p>
<p>(They kiss)</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, is this like &lsquo;I have an early class tomorrow&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m secretly married to a goat?&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Well it&rsquo;s somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I&rsquo;m not uh&hellip;, well I, I mean I haven&rsquo;t ever uh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ethan?</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you a virgin?</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Well, if that&rsquo;s what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I&rsquo;ve kinda been waiting for the right person.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?</p>
<p>(They kiss)</p>
<p>[Time lapse. They are now in Monica&rsquo;s bedroom, on the bed.]</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Wow!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You keep saying that.</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.</p>
<p>(They kiss)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Oh god, don&rsquo;t tell me, I did it wrong.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No-no. Nothing wrong about that.</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Um, okay, here it goes. I&rsquo;m not 22. I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m 25&hellip; and thirteen months.</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Huh!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> But I figured, you know, that shouldn&rsquo;t change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.</p>
<p>(They kiss)</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Uh, listen um, as long as we&rsquo;re telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I&rsquo;m a little younger than I said.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You&rsquo;re not a senior?</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m a senior&hellip; in High School.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok&hellip;ay.</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn&rsquo;t alive during the Bicentennial.</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> I just had sex.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Well, you never told me how old you were.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, that&rsquo;s different. My lie didn&rsquo;t make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> I wasn&rsquo;t thinking. I was too busy fallin&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Don&rsquo;t say it. (closes Ethan&rsquo;s mouth with her hand)</p>

<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Who?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, everyone exept Monica is there.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (on phone) Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, forget it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly&hellip; saucy?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to Ross, who&rsquo;s listening very carefully) Joey was there too.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. (Moves closer.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Was there&hellip;uh, huh, huh, huh&hellip; andybody, anybody else there.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You&rsquo;re sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, it was just the three of us.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) You know what?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> There were times when it wasn&rsquo;t even me.</p>
<p>(Chandler and Joey laughs, until they look at each other then recoil in horror.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)</p>
<p>(Monica enters, wearing a walkman, so she doesn&rsquo;t hear what the others say)</p>
<p><b>Ross, Rachel, and</b> <b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Mon.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?</p>
<p><b>All:</b> (shouting) Mon!</p>
<p>(Monica takes of her walkman)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ethan called again.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you not seeing him anymore?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No. You know, sometimes just things doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.</p>
<p>(Monica stares at Rachel)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I, I didn&rsquo;t say any&hellip; I sw&hellip; I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest <em>Power Ranger</em> is?</p>
<p>(Ross and Chandler laughs)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?</p>
<p><b>Joey, Chander, and</b> <b>Ross:</b> Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s morphin time!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Stegosaurus!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tyrannosaurus!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, oh, I&rsquo;ve gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, oh, I&rsquo;ve got a birthday party, with some work people.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Work people? Nobody told me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, I know. That&rsquo;s a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, I don&rsquo;t get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I&rsquo;m in charge doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m a different person.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You think I should?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I really do, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don&rsquo;t wanna be the geek that invited the boss.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s office, he and Phoebe are taking a break from work.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing <em>Ebony and Ivory</em>.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You were great. But they still made fun of you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You know, now you&rsquo;re more like, you know like, &ldquo;Mr. Caring Boss,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;, you know, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of you, Boss,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then, I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, you know what Chandler? I think you&rsquo;ve gotta face it. You&rsquo;re like, the guy in the big office, you know. You&rsquo;re the one that hires them, that fires them&hellip; They still say you&rsquo;re a great boss.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> They do?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh huh. But they&rsquo;re not your friends anymore.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I just wan&rsquo;t to&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, but you can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Aren&rsquo;t you gonna&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she&rsquo;s having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What about André?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.</p>
<p>(Ethan enters)</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That was gonna be my opener.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I thought that was just a rumour.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> True story.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> They&rsquo;re here already?</p>
<p>(Rachel, Ross and Ross go to the bathroom)</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> All right, look. I&rsquo;ve gotta tell you something. I&rsquo;m not 17. I only said so that you&rsquo;d think I was cute and vunerable. I&rsquo;m actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I&rsquo;m your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we&rsquo;re great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It was.</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Then, what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ethan, it&rsquo;s um&hellip; it&rsquo;s icky.</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> Icky? You&rsquo;re actually gonna throw this away because it&rsquo;s icky?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> This isn&rsquo;t easy for me either. I wish things were different, I&hellip; If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Young Ethan:</b> No, don&rsquo;t say it. (closes Monica&rsquo;s mouth with his hand)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &hellip;love you.</p>
<p>(Ross, Rachel and Joey come back from the bathroom. They discover that Monica and Ethan aren&rsquo;t finished talking to each other yet.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you&rsquo;re hands still wet?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, moist, yeah.</p>
