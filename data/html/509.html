<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, the entire gang is there, eating breakfast. Phoebe is on the couch, fidgeting.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What am I sitting on?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can&rsquo;t) I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies!</p>
<p>(She throws them into the kitchen and Rachel picks them up with the handle of a large spoon. Chandler and Monica have horrified looks on their faces.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right! Who&rsquo;s are they? Who&rsquo;s are they?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, they&rsquo;re not mine!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, they&rsquo;re Joey&rsquo;s! They gotta be Joey&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>(Rachel turns and stares at him.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, they&rsquo;re mine.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> See? They&rsquo;re Joey&rsquo;s! J-J-J-J-J-Joey&rsquo;s!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why are they here?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know uhh&hellip; (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I&rsquo;m Joey. Yeah, I&rsquo;m disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, get &rsquo;em out of here! What&rsquo;s wrong with you?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (waving them in his face) Take &rsquo;em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of the way.) Joey, you can touch them! They&rsquo;re <b>your</b> underwear.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.</p>
<p>(Follows Joey into their apartment and shrugs on his way out.)</p>
<p>[Cut to the guy&rsquo;s apartment.]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s it! I&rsquo;m tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! (Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler&rsquo;s room.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh hey, no, you&rsquo;re not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y&rsquo;know that is a tough spot.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, yeah actually.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We&rsquo;ll try to be more careful okay? It&rsquo;s just that, we don&rsquo;t want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it&rsquo;s going really well is because it&rsquo;s a secret.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know it sounds really weird, but we&rsquo;re just so bad at relationships.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We are! Help us!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Help!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there as Phoebe enters with her nose stuck in a book.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Phoebe!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi, Pheebs!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you reading?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, <i>Wethering Heights</i>. I&rsquo;m taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I didn&rsquo;t know you were taking a class. That is so cool.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y&rsquo;know and this time I thought I&rsquo;d go for something, y&rsquo;know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey that sounds like fun.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I&rsquo;d have someone to sit with!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Okay&mdash;ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I read that in high school.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering, depressed) Hi.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What&rsquo;s wrong buddy?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Someone at work ate my sandwich!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, what did the police say?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can&rsquo;t believe someone ate it!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ross, it&rsquo;s just a sandwich!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I&rsquo;m about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone <b>ate</b> the only good thing going on in my life!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I <b>still can&rsquo;t believe someone ate it</b>!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.</p>
<p>(Shows the note to Chandler who reads it aloud.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (reading) Knock-knock. Who&rsquo;s there? Ross Geller&rsquo;s lunch. Ross Geller&rsquo;s lunch, who? Ross Geller&rsquo;s lunch, please don&rsquo;t take me. Okay?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m surprised you didn&rsquo;t go home wearing your lunch.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, &ldquo;Keep your mitts off my grub?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the <b>entire</b> cast of <i>Annie</i>?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and the gang reads it.)</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Whoa! Ohh!!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, you are a bad ass!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Someday I&rsquo;ll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he stabbed me first!!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Phoebe&rsquo;s class, the class has already started and Rachel walks in late.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Phoebe) Sorry I&rsquo;m late, but I left late.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So Pheebs, what is the book about?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I thought you said you read it in high school.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway&mdash;umm, what is this book about?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, umm, it&rsquo;s this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which <b>I</b> think represents the wildness of Heathcliff&rsquo;s character. I totally get symbolism.</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let&rsquo;s see here (looks at his attendance sheet), Rachel Green?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, well I would have to say that it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s tragic love story.</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Well, that&rsquo;s sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which <b>I</b> think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, honey that was pretty obvious.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well how would you know?! You didn&rsquo;t even read it!</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> What do you think? You in the blue shirt.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Would ya care to venture one?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Would <b>you</b> care to venture one?</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Are you just repeating what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Are you just repeating what <b>I&rsquo;m</b> saying?</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> All right, let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay then.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel return from the class.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah but why didn&rsquo;t you just say that you didn&rsquo;t read the book?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Be-because I didn&rsquo;t want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Phoebe!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Phoebe! You&rsquo;re note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I&rsquo;m telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!</p>
<p>(Joey casually pushes Ross over the back of the couch and sits down proud of himself.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The hallway, Joey is returning from a date with Cynthia.</h3>
<p><b>Cynthia:</b> God, this was really fun! I&rsquo;ve been wondering if you were going to ask me out.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So you uh, still wondering?</p>
<p><b>Cynthia:</b> No, we just went out.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You&rsquo;re smart. I like that.</p>
<p>(He goes to open the door to his apartment, but finds it locked. As he&rsquo;s getting out his keys, Chandler and Monica quickly jump up from making out in the living room and run to Chandler&rsquo;s bedroom. The apartment has about 20 candles burning all over the place. Joey opens the door and ushers Cynthia in.)</p>
<p><b>Cynthia:</b> Oh, candles! (Notices something.) What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God! (As she storms out, Rachel returns and overhears the conversation.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!</p>
<p><b>Cynthia:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date! (She storms away and Rachel enters to confront Joey.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hiya.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, is what she just said umm&mdash;Oh my God. (Looks around the room.) You were actually gonna&hellip; (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (Rachel stares in shock.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What is going on here?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?</p>
<p>(Chandler silently pleads with Joey to cover for them.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m Joey. I mean, I&rsquo;m disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points at Chandler, angrily.)</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler, Joey, and Ross&rsquo;s; continued from earlier. Joey is closing the door after Rachel leaves and is about to confront Chandler and Monica.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You guys <b>promised</b> you&rsquo;d be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We&rsquo;re so sorry.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m telling everyone about you! That&rsquo;s the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn&rsquo;t make me look like a pig!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no, wait! There&rsquo;s got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you <b>had</b> to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found <b>my</b> underwear at your place?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, just wait, please. I promise we&rsquo;ll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Museum of Prehistoric History (Ross&rsquo;s work); Ross is in the break room eating lunch as his boss, Dr. Leedbetter walks in.</h3>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, of course, Donald.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> We&rsquo;ve been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (Proudly) Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no, you-you don&rsquo;t understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> (laughs) A sandwich?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> (laughs) Oh, you know what?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> I-I&rsquo;m sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You ate my sandwich?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (getting angry) That said it was <b>my</b> sandwich?!</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (jumping to his feet in anger) What?</p>
<p><b>Dr. Leedbetter:</b> Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!</p>
<p>[Cut to an outside shot of the museum.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!</p>
<p>[Cut to a shot of a park.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> <b>MY SANDWICH!!!!!!</b> (Ross&rsquo;s scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Phoebe and Rachel&rsquo;s class; Rachel walks in, on time this time.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sitting down) So umm, what&rsquo;s this book about?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You didn&rsquo;t read this one either?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>Vogue</i>! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! You should&rsquo;ve read it yourself!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on Phoebe! Don&rsquo;t be such a goodie-goodie!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;s a woman, but she&rsquo;s not. She&rsquo;s a cyborg.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> A cyborg?! Isn&rsquo;t that like a robot?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> (entering) Sorry I&rsquo;m late. Let&rsquo;s get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Well, go ahead Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> If you&rsquo;re talking about feminism, I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch as Monica joins him.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn&rsquo;t work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (gasps) You&rsquo;re <b>naked</b> in this picture!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>
<p>(Ross walks in, eating cotton candy. Monica nudges Chandler who hides the picture in his magazine. Ross sits down on the chair, he seems kinda out of it.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ross?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, are you okay?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> On account of my rage.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Which I may say, right now, is out of control.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He gave me a pill for it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> A pill?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute, they&rsquo;re making you take time off work?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And you&rsquo;re okay with that?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don&rsquo;t care about my sandwich.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel and Phoebe are returning from class.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can&rsquo;t believe you let me go on and on like that!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (smiling) I&rsquo;m sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing <i>Jane Eyre</i> to <i>Robocop</i>.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That was <b>not</b> funny!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren&rsquo;t taking the class seriously.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y&rsquo;know, I thought it would be fun!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y&rsquo;know I also wanted to learn. Y&rsquo;know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y&rsquo;know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Class; Monica has taken Rachel&rsquo;s spot.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!</p>
<p><b>The Teacher:</b> Monica, you <b>asked</b> the question.</p>
<p>(She sits back defeated, and Phoebe groans with disgust.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler, Joey, and Ross&rsquo;s; Joey returns carrying a bucket of chicken, and starts going through the mail. While doing this, Monica&rsquo;s picture falls out. He bends over to pick it up and gasps. While he&rsquo;s staring at the picture, Rachel decides to come over and sees him looking at the picture.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sees the picture) Oh my God! That&rsquo;s Monica!!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering, with the rest of the gang) What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey has got a secret peephole!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!</p>
<p>(Ross stares in shock at him as he angrily puts down the chicken and takes off his coat.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (covering his eyes) Dude! That&rsquo;s my sister! (She shows the rest of the gang.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (grabbing the picture) Give me that!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let&rsquo;s give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he&rsquo;s such a big pervert!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No! I am <b>not</b> a pervert! Okay? It&rsquo;s just&hellip; I just&hellip; Kinda&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.</p>
<p>(He walks over and stands behind Joey.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey&rsquo;s a sex addict.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who&rsquo;s silently pleading with Joey to go along with it.) No I&rsquo;m not!!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s okay! It&rsquo;s good! It&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s a disease!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No! No! I am <b>not</b> a sex addict!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes you are! That&rsquo;s the only way to explain all this stuff!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No it isn&rsquo;t! No, it&rsquo;s not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what is the truth?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (thinking) I slept with Monica.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well let&rsquo;s&hellip;let&rsquo;s see what everybody thinks of that?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You slept with my sister?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, is this true?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Of course it&rsquo;s true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that&rsquo;s been going on?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahh&mdash;oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> My God Monica!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you&rsquo;re not just a sex addict?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No! If anyone&rsquo;s a sex addict here, it&rsquo;s Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So that&rsquo;s why she gave you a naked picture of herself.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That makes sense!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And the video camera?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhh, Monica?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But sadly I could not be enticed.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey&rsquo;s underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m Monica. I&rsquo;m disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I think we&rsquo;ve all learned something about who&rsquo;s disgusting and who&rsquo;s not. Eh? All right, now, I&rsquo;m going to get back to my bucket. I&rsquo;m only eating the skin, so the chicken&rsquo;s up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)</p>
