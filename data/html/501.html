<p><b>Ross:</b> I, Ross&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Minister:</b> Take thee, <b>EM-I-LY</b>&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Take thee, (Glares at the Minister) <b>Emily</b>. (Chuckles) Like there&rsquo;d be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.)</p>
<p><b>Minister:</b> As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily. (Points at her.)</p>
<p><b>Minister:</b> May I have the rings? (He is given the rings) Emily, place this ring on Ross&rsquo;s finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. (She jams the ring onto his finger) Ross, place this ring in Emily&rsquo;s hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Happy too.</p>
<p><b>Minister:</b> Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yay!</p>

<p>(He goes to kiss her, but she isn&rsquo;t very receptive of the kiss. She keeps avoiding him, until Ross finally gets to kiss her on her cheek.)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> (To Mr. Geller) This is worse than when he married the lesbian.</p>
<p>(The band starts to play, and the recessional starts. Ross tries to take Emily&rsquo;s hand, but she snatches it away from him.)</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> Just keep smiling.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, that went well. Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It could&rsquo;ve been worse, he could&rsquo;ve shot her.</p>
<p>(Ross and Emily make it to the lobby.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>(Emily gives him a forearm shot across the stomach.)</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Wedding reception, Ross and Emily are in the bathroom and Emily is yelling at him. Rachel, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are standing outside the doorway.</h3>
<p><b>Emily:</b> (Yelling from inside the bathroom) You&rsquo;ve spoiled everything! It&rsquo;s like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (exiting the bathroom) That-that-that&rsquo;s all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I&rsquo;ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the gang) She&rsquo;s just fixing her makeup.</p>
<p><b>Emily:</b> I hate you!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else joins him.)</p>
<p>(Mrs. Waltham&rsquo;s phone rings and she answers it.)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> Yes, Waltham interiors.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller&rsquo;s personal physician, Dr. Philange.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> Who?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women&rsquo;s names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> Oh my God, Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!</p>
<p>(Mrs. Waltham hangs up on her.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hello?</p>
<p>(Cut to Chandler and Monica at the buffet table.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh wow, I hope you don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I&rsquo;m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know. How could we have let this happen?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Seven times!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ugh! Well, y&rsquo;know, we were away&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> In a <b>foreign</b>, romantic country&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I blame London.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So look umm, while we&rsquo;re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I don&rsquo;t see that we have a choice. But, when we&rsquo;re back home, we don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Only here.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;ll meet you there in two minutes.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>
<p>(He throws down his plate and runs to the wine cellar, Monica is about to follow him but is intercepted by Rachel.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (impatiently) Now?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can&rsquo;t pretend that didn&rsquo;t happen can I?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I-I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica, what should I do?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave, but is stopped by Rachel.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoa, wait, listen, I think I&rsquo;m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait. Rachel, no, he&rsquo;s married. Married! If you don&rsquo;t realize that, I can&rsquo;t help you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, you&rsquo;re right. You&rsquo;re right. You can&rsquo;t help me.</p>
<p>(Cut to Mr. and Mrs. Geller.)</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Geller:</b> Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> (walking by) Yes.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Geller:</b> Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there&rsquo;s no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, what&rsquo;s up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak, he&rsquo;s eating it with his hands.)</p>
<p>(Cut to Monica and Chandler, Monica is running up to him.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Forget it, that&rsquo;s off.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why?!</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> (drunkenly) The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes&hellip;</p>
<p>(Joey walks up to them.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn&rsquo;t eat meat until she has the babies!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I figured we&rsquo;re in another country, so it doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> The man&rsquo;s got a point.</p>
<p>(Cut to Rachel and Ross.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi. Sorry, things aren&rsquo;t working out so well.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no! It could be better, but it&rsquo;s gonna be okay, right?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she&rsquo;s gonna get over this, y&rsquo;know? I mean, so you said my name! Y&rsquo;know you just said it &lsquo;cause you saw me there, if you&rsquo;d have seen a circus freak, you would&rsquo;ve said, &ldquo;I take thee circus freak.&rdquo; Y&rsquo;know, it didn&rsquo;t mean anything, it&rsquo;s just a mistake. It didn&rsquo;t mean anything. Right?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! Of course it didn&rsquo;t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y&rsquo;know, because-because it was you&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> But it absolutely didn&rsquo;t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn&rsquo;t!! It didn&rsquo;t!!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (approaching) Ross, hey, the band&rsquo;s ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band&rsquo;s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care about the stupid band!!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Y&rsquo;know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, right!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Get the hell out of there, y&rsquo;know?</p>
<p>(They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realize what she just said and run over to the bathroom.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I&rsquo;m coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, look at that, same thing.</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: <i>London Marriott</i>, Monica and Chandler are walking to her room.]</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, &ldquo;Yippee!&rdquo; just ignore me.</p>
<p>(She laughs and opens the door to reveal Rachel sitting on the bed.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, hello Rachel.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross said my name. Okay? <b>My</b> name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don&rsquo;t believe me, I know I&rsquo;m right&mdash;do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes, I want to change. And why-why don&rsquo;t you go down and get us a table?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we&rsquo;ll be down in like five minutes.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (elbows him) Fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p>(The phone rings and Rachel answers it.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It&rsquo;s Phoebe!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, yay&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Great&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi, so what happened?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, Ross said my name.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I know, but I don&rsquo;t think that means anything.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, Pheebs, y&rsquo;know what, let&rsquo;s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don&rsquo;t we go change in my room?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> But my clothes are&mdash;ohh! (They both leave.)</p>
<p>(Cut to Chandler&rsquo;s room, he opens the door slowly to see if Joey is there and after seeing that he isn&rsquo;t, ushers Monica into the room, closes the door, and the security bar.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, you look&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No time for that!</p>
<p>(They both start to frantically rip each other&rsquo;s clothes off, but are interrupted when Joey tries to open the door.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&rsquo;ve got a girl in here.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No you don&rsquo;t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, we&rsquo;re-we&rsquo;re hanging out in here!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I suppose I&rsquo;d have to say you!! But, what if we&rsquo;re watching a movie in here?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It&rsquo;s <i>My Giant</i>!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> <i>My Giant</i>? I <b>love</b> that movie!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross and Emily&rsquo;s room, Chandler and Monica are still looking for a place to do the deed.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You really think this is okay?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, Ross and Emily aren&rsquo;t gonna use it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s so beautiful. Ohh! Y&rsquo;know, I-I don&rsquo;t know if I feel right about this.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The <b>room</b> expects sex. The <b>room</b> would be disappointed if it didn&rsquo;t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>
<p>(They both run to rip the covers off the bed, but are interrupted by Ross.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Emily?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nope, not under here!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You didn&rsquo;t find her?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I&rsquo;ve looked everywhere!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you couldn&rsquo;t have looked everywhere or else you would&rsquo;ve found her!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I think you should keep looking!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Or 45.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No! For all I know, she&rsquo;s trying to find me but couldn&rsquo;t because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I&rsquo;m staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, it&rsquo;s getting late.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna go.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ugh, y&rsquo;know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s a very large plane.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (disappointed) That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> But, we&rsquo;ll stay here with you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate this, y&rsquo;know, but you don&rsquo;t have to rub my butt.</p>
<p>(Chandler slowly takes his hand away.)</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross and Emily&rsquo;s room, the next morning. Ross is now asleep and has his head in Monica&rsquo;s lap and his feet on Chandler&rsquo;s lap. Monica and Chandler are both still awake and depressed.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We have to leave for New York in an hour.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know, I&rsquo;ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We can&rsquo;t do that that&rsquo;s insane. I mean &lsquo;A&rsquo; he could wake up and &lsquo;B&rsquo; y&rsquo;know, let&rsquo;s go for it.</p>
<p>(They both try to slowly extricate themselves from Ross, but there&rsquo;s a knock on the door that awakens him.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> You can forget about Emily, she&rsquo;s not with us.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> We&rsquo;ve come for her things.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> She&rsquo;s in hiding. She&rsquo;s utterly humiliated. She doesn&rsquo;t want to see you ever again.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> We&rsquo;re very sad that it didn&rsquo;t work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you&rsquo;re absolutely delicious.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Excuse me, I&rsquo;m standing right here!</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> Oh yes, there you are.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there&rsquo;s a whole cart outside&hellip; (Sees the Walthams and stops.)</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Goodbye Geller.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I&rsquo;m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she&rsquo;ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel&rsquo;s name, but it didn&rsquo;t mean anything, Okay? She&rsquo;s-she&rsquo;s just a friend and that&rsquo;s all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That&rsquo;s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can&rsquo;t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you&rsquo;ll tell her that.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> All right, I&rsquo;ll tell her. (To his wife) Come on bugger face!</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Waltham:</b> (As she walks pass Ross, she pats his but.) Call me.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don&rsquo;t you ever go out the bloody window!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A 747 somewhere over the North Atlantic, Monica and Chandler are sitting in first class, depressed.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Y&rsquo;know, maybe it&rsquo;s best that we never got to do it again.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Y&rsquo;know, technically we still <b>are</b> over international waters.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I&rsquo;ll see you there in a bit?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &lsquo;Kay!</p>
<p>(Monica gets up and heads for the bathroom, Chandler turns to watch her go and is startled to see Joey sitting in Monica&rsquo;s seat.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uhh, no.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Felicity and I, we&rsquo;re watching <i>My Giant</i>, and I was thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.&rdquo; Do you think I&rsquo;m just wasting my life with this acting thing?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y&rsquo;know, you think I&rsquo;ll ever get there?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks man.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> But what about how much taller he is than me?</p>
<p>(Time lapse, Chandler is finishing his third little bottle of booze.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I mean, there&rsquo;s no way I can make myself taller now, y&rsquo;know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?</p>
<p>(Monica returns.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Monica, wow you&rsquo;ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I know!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Had the beef-tips, huh?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Phoebe is eating cereal from a bowl she has balanced on her stomach as Joey, Chandler, and Monica return.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi!</p>
<p>(They all hug.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You had sex! (They&rsquo;re shocked.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No we didn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know you didn&rsquo;t, I was talking about Monica.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Phoebe, I did not have sex.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> This pregnancy is throwing me all off.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, I&rsquo;m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, me too!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Why would you need to say hi to them, you&rsquo;ve been feeding them for four days?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh right, maybe I&rsquo;ll just go home.</p>
<p>(She grabs her bag and leaves, Joey moves a little quicker to his apartment, leaving Monica and Chandler alone.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, we certainly are alone.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! Good thing we have that, &lsquo;Not in New York&rsquo; rule.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Right. Umm, listen since we&rsquo;re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross&rsquo;s mother&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, an-anyway, I just&mdash;that night meant a lot to me, I guess I&rsquo;m just trying to say thanks.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. Y&rsquo;know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn&rsquo;t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me &lsquo;cause, you&rsquo;re really hot! Is that okay?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And I&rsquo;m cute too.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And you&rsquo;re cute too.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Bye.</p>
<p>(After he closes the door, Monica starts to follow him, but thinks better of it and stops.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) I&rsquo;m still on London time, does that count?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That counts!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, good! (They start kissing.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> An airport in London, Ross is waiting for Emily to show up to go on their honeymoon and sees Rachel walking past.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach! Rach!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (she stops and turns) Hi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, I-I-I&rsquo;ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Not yet.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?</p>
<p><b>Gate Agent:</b> (On the P.A.) This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Pretty soon I guess.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I just, I don&rsquo;t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y&rsquo;know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she&rsquo;d actually show up?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, you&rsquo;re not an idiot, Ross. You&rsquo;re a guy very much in love.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Same difference.</p>
<p><b>Gate Agent:</b> (On the P.A.) All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I get it! Well, that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, you know what, I think you should go.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it&rsquo;d be really good.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be <b>really</b> good for you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I could, yeah, I can do that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t even believe her! No, y&rsquo;know what, I am, I am gonna go!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Good!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know, why not?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well-well, I don&rsquo;t know Ross&mdash;really?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to Ross&rsquo;s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey, look at that, the airport&rsquo;s moving. (Realizes that that&rsquo;s not how it works.) Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we&rsquo;re moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.</p>
