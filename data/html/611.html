<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s, everyone is there as Joey enters happily.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, we have been through this before!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Don&rsquo;t do this to yourself.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> She&rsquo;s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well all right then, I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t get to excited about the fact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You serious?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s great!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah well, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You kissed her.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh we kissed it up real nice.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So you kissed her, so what happened after that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I came over here to tell you guys.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So she&rsquo;s just waiting over there for ya?</p>
<p>(Joey nods yes, but suddenly realizes what he did and runs out of the apartment and back to his place.)</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey and Janine are pretty much making out at one of the tables as Monica and Rachel look on from the couch.</h3>
<p><b>Janine:</b> I gotta go.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. (They kiss.)</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> I&rsquo;m gonna be really late for dance class!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. (They kiss.)</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Okay, now I&rsquo;m really late. (Gets up.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, I&rsquo;m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips? (She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> (to Monica and Rachel) Bye.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye. (Janine exits.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Have you kissed her yet? It&rsquo;s awesome! I could do it forever! Y&rsquo;know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I am <b>so</b> glad you said cooks.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have <b>got</b> to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. (Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh, <i>Pottery Barn</i>! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m not your garbage man. I&rsquo;m your mailman.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows her the picture.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You got it from <i>Pottery Barn</i>?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! It&rsquo;s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, Phoebe hates <i>Pottery Barn</i>.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I hate <i>Pottery Barn</i> too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (indignant) I was tired!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe hates <i>Pottery Barn</i>?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s gotta be one of a kind. Y&rsquo;know like umm, y&rsquo;know uh, what&rsquo;s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey! I made that for her!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You made pottery?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m telling&mdash;If you put that in her apartment you&rsquo;ll never hear the end of it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay fine! I&rsquo;ll-I&rsquo;ll just tell her it&rsquo;s an antique apothecary table, she doesn&rsquo;t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore&hellip;</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Hallway between the apartments, Joey, Janine, Chandler, and Monica are returning from a double date. Chandler is telling a joke.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;so then the farmer says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a cow and you&rsquo;re not milking it.&rdquo; (Everyone laughs.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look at us, we&rsquo;re a couple of couples!</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> And Chandler I can&rsquo;t believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug and he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I&rsquo;ll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Oh that would be great!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, you don&rsquo;t have too!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get the wine right?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> See ya tomorrow!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Tomorrow!</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Can&rsquo;t wait! (They each go into their respective apartments.)</p>
<p>[Cut to Joey and Janine&rsquo;s.]</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> How are we gonna get out of that one?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> I can&rsquo;t handle two nights in a row with them.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What-what&rsquo;s wrong with Monica and Chandler?</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, they&rsquo;re just a little blah!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Blah?!</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Well y&rsquo;know, he&rsquo;s blah, she&rsquo;s just&mdash;she&rsquo;s very loud for such a small person.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, they&rsquo;re like my best friends. Are you saying we can&rsquo;t hang out with them? &lsquo;Cause that would kinda be a problem.</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y&rsquo;know, not two nights in a row. Okay?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I guess.</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Thank you. (They kiss.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> If you want, I&rsquo;ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Phoebe and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is placing CDs into her antique apothecary table as Phoebe returns home.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Guess!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, a flea market?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ha! See, I knew, I knew you&rsquo;d get it on the first guess. Isn&rsquo;t it cool! It&rsquo;s an apothecary table.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She&rsquo;s opening and closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, yes.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&rsquo;know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Almost.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How much was it?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It was only 500 bucks.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> 500 bucks at a flea market?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y&rsquo;know like back then.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y&rsquo;know, it was like a dollar.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> A dollar?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, what period is it from?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, it&rsquo;s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y&rsquo;know?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, yes I do. God, oh it&rsquo;s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y&rsquo;know where it was from or&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (gasps) White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross&rsquo;s apartment, Rachel is entering as Ross comes out of the kitchen carrying popcorn.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! We&rsquo;re here!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You like it?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It&rsquo;s my new apothecary table!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross! Phoebe&rsquo;s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well why not?! She&rsquo;ll-she&rsquo;ll love it! It&rsquo;s the real thing! I got it at <i>Pottery Barn</i>.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she&rsquo;s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why did you do that?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because she hates <i>Pottery Barn</i>.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She hates <i>Pottery Barn</i>?!!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know! I know, she says it&rsquo;s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come on, she&rsquo;s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe&mdash;Ooh, although I did get some great <i>Pottery Barn</i> sheets! (Gets them.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, yeah! I still can&rsquo;t believe she hates <i>Pottery Barn</i>!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, get over it! It&rsquo;s not like she hates you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah but <i>Pottery Barn</i>! Y&rsquo;know what I think? It&rsquo;s just she-she&rsquo;s weird. Y&rsquo;know it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s a twin. Twins are weird.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, she&rsquo;s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Huh. Y&rsquo;know what&rsquo;s not one of a kind? A twin!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, Phoebe&rsquo;s here! Okay, let&rsquo;s turn out all the lights and we&rsquo;ll just watch the movie!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Hey&mdash;Ooh, cool sheets! (Notices the sheet over the table.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sure!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> He got it a flea market!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey and Janine&rsquo;s, Joey is pacing around as Chandler and Monica enter.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn&rsquo;t afford it, because you paid dinner last night.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it&rsquo;s just gonna be me again tonight.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What happened to Janine?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, she&rsquo;s uh-uh really sick.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh that&rsquo;s too bad.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, she&rsquo;s been in there all day (Points to her room), uh high fever, a nose problem&hellip; Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> (entering from her room) Monica! Chandler! I&rsquo;m really-really sorry about tonight. I don&rsquo;t know if Joey told you; I just couldn&rsquo;t get out of going to this play. I&rsquo;m sorry. Have a great time.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &lsquo;Kay!</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Bye. (Exits)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s funny, I saw no phlegm.</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey and Janine&rsquo;s, continued from earlier.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, she really is sick!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Then why-why is she going to a play?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, y&rsquo;know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well uh, she didn&rsquo;t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And I am not blah, I am a hoot!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don&rsquo;t-don&rsquo;t be mad. I&rsquo;m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y&rsquo;know? And it was our first date! Plus, she&rsquo;s really sick!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, you sh&mdash;No you said you made that up!!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I know, but don&rsquo;t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Eh, they&rsquo;re both good. I generally just go with, Monica&rsquo;s drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She&rsquo;ll come around I promise.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p>(They exit and close the door.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (from the hallway) I do <b>not</b> like that woman!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (shouting) I can hear you!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I <b>am</b> loud!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Ross&rsquo;s apartment, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are watching a movie.</h3>
<p><b>All:</b> Aww! (They all laugh.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross&rsquo;s table.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new&hellip;(On Rachel&rsquo;s glare)&hellip;old sheet?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her which spills the wine.) Noo!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh!!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> My apothecary table!!!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same apothecary table they have.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ross, where did you get this?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I got it at <i>Pottery Barn</i>!! Okay?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, Phoebe, <i>Pottery Barn</i> has ripped off the design of our antique!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow! Oh my God, well if they&rsquo;ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yes.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well this doesn&rsquo;t even smell like opium.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh Ross, calm down, I&rsquo;ll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at Rachel)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s, Monica and Chandler are sitting at the kitchen table.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, one more time.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Perfect decibel.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (loudly) I know!!!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So uh, what are you guys doing?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh nothing, we&rsquo;re just talking. Y&rsquo;know, blah-blah-blah.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I&rsquo;d like to but, (extremely quietly) I&rsquo;m not sure we have time to go.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ha-ha, very funny&mdash;Look! I don&rsquo;t know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We owe you?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That&rsquo;s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We didn&rsquo;t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You don&rsquo;t think I know that!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Phoebe and Rachel&rsquo;s, Rachel is showing Ross around the newly decorated living room.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> &hellip;see I can&rsquo;t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow! I didn&rsquo;t know that there was a <i>Pottery Barn</i> up here.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know, I know. I went a little crazy.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ah!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well there&rsquo;s yore. And uh, y&rsquo;know, yesteryear.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah no, I&rsquo;m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y&rsquo;know if you ever decide you need to redecorate&mdash;And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh honey he doesn&rsquo;t need my help.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, come on! I think he&rsquo;s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y&rsquo;know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here&rsquo;s-here&rsquo;s 60 bucks, why don&rsquo;t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (not sure of what to do) Y&rsquo;know what? I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think Phoebe really wants to come.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! I do want to!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, she does want to.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She does want to.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Street, Phoebe and Rachel are heading back from that Colonial flea market.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebs, I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p>(They walk by a <i>Pottery Barn</i> window display.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uck, look at this! <i>Pottery Barn</i>, yuck!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, y&rsquo;know what? Don&rsquo;t look at it. (Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously, don&rsquo;t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! Look-look! There&rsquo;s the coffee table they stole from us!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ugh, those bastards! Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the&hellip;wait a sec! This is our exact living room!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! No! No! No it&rsquo;s not! No it&rsquo;s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don&rsquo;t have the&hellip; (Looks desperately for something different.) We don&rsquo;t have the&hellip;that lamp! And-and that screen is y&rsquo;know, on the other side.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, <i>Pottery Barn</i>! Oh my God!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay! Okay-okay look&mdash;no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about <i>Pottery Barn</i>. Just&hellip; Come on don&rsquo;t be mad.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it&rsquo;s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don&rsquo;t have that lamp!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t! Unless&hellip; Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn&rsquo;t buy that lamp?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! No! I&rsquo;m not gonna move out!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But are you saying that you would move out if I didn&rsquo;t buy that lamp?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would <b>so</b> move out!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay then I don&rsquo;t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s right!</p>
<p>(They start to go inside.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But at least the apothecary table is real.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The hallway, Joey, Janine, Monica, and Chandler are returning from their second date.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, this-this-this was great. Didn&rsquo;t everybody have a great time?</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I&rsquo;ve got to say, I&rsquo;m sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s totally understandable.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> So we can go out again?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Absolutely!</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Oh good.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh well then, good night!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)</p>
<p>[Cut to Joey and Janine&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re entering.]</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> See? Eh, wasn&rsquo;t that fun?</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> We have <b>got</b> to move!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (bursting in) I <b>knew</b> it!! Y&rsquo;know, you&rsquo;re not so quiet yourself, missy!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And I&rsquo;m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) &ldquo;Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I know you&rsquo;re talking, but all I hear is, &ldquo;Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let&rsquo;s go! Right now!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) Y&rsquo;know I think you can take her.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (to Janine) You&rsquo;d better hope I don&rsquo;t see you in the hallway!! (They exit.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, uh, we&rsquo;ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can&rsquo;t treat them that way.</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> They said stuff to me too, y&rsquo;know!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I know! I know! And I&rsquo;m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They&hellip; They&rsquo;re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think we can be together. It just, it just can&rsquo;t work. It can&rsquo;t. (Starts to break up) I&rsquo;m very upset.</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her and she exits into the hallway.)</p>
<p>[Cut to the hallway, Janine is entering as Monica is taking out the garbage.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What did I tell you about the hall?!</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I&rsquo;d really like it if we could be friends.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Great.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I&rsquo;m glad we worked things out.</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Me too.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> I&rsquo;ll see you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> (muttering to herself) Or I&rsquo;ll hear you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (hearing that) That&rsquo;s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with the garbage bag) Come on!</p>
<p><b>Janine:</b> Wait! (Janine pauses, then runs down the stairs.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (chasing her) You&rsquo;d better run!</p>
<p>(Joey and Chandler both come into the hallway.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Did you hear that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! (They head downstairs.)</p>
