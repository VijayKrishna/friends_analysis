<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey, Monica, and Rachel are sitting on the couch and Ross is sitting on the chair, and they&rsquo;re all talking.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Probably Monica and Chandler.</p>
<p>(A woman walks up to Gunther in the background.)</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> (to Gunther) Hi. Could I have a pack of <i>Newport Lights</i>, please?</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> Oh umm, uh we don&rsquo;t sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street. (Points.)</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> That&rsquo;d be great, thanks. (Gunther goes and gets them.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don&rsquo;t think I have the energy for this.</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> (Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (screaming) Melissa!</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what&rsquo;s up with you?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wh&mdash;(Turns and looks at the gang who&rsquo;s staring)&mdash;Why don&rsquo;t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> So last I heard you were gonna get married. (Grabs Rachel&rsquo;s hand and notices that she doesn&rsquo;t have a ring on it.) (Sadly) Oh poor Ray-ray.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no-no, no! It&rsquo;s good! It&rsquo;s all good! I-I actually work at <i>Ralph Lauren</i>!</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> Shut up!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I will not! I&rsquo;m the divisional head of men&rsquo;s sportswear!</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh please&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> (excitedly) Are you?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh tomorrow, oh I don&rsquo;t know. Um&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> You do now. You&rsquo;re having dinner with me.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Shut up.</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> I-I&rsquo;ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! (Gunther returns with her cigarettes.) Oh, there you are. (Takes them from Gunther.) (To Rachel) Umm, so listen, just call me. Here&rsquo;s my card. (Hands the card over.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you&rsquo;re in real estate!</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> Oh no, that&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! What do you do now?</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> (quietly) I&rsquo;m a party planner. I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow. (Exits.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey guys! Look who&rsquo;s back! It&rsquo;s Ray-ray!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Shut up, that was my friend Melissa from college.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She seems <b>really</b>, <b>really</b> fun!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> She&rsquo;s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait a minute, she isn&rsquo;t&hellip; She&rsquo;s not the one who you&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Monica) Yes.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wow!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you&mdash;what?!!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&rsquo;s not a big deal!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Joey) They were lovers.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No we weren&rsquo;t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a <b>lot</b> of sangria and y&rsquo;know, ended up&hellip;kissing for a bit.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So that&rsquo;s two of my wives.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s, Monica is working on the seating chart while Chandler looks on and Rachel reads.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay, so this is where the band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have people&rsquo;s names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachel&rsquo;s place.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wow. Why don&rsquo;t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs. Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren&rsquo;t for playing are they?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, relax it&rsquo;s not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a close one.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hello!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Rach. (Stares at her.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Stop picturing it!!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I think that&rsquo;s it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they&rsquo;re having fun don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh! (Gets up) Let&rsquo;s see, well&hellip;if this is the wedding hall then umm (Walks away) you&rsquo;re parents will be at home in Queens.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What, they&rsquo;re not invited?! Oh no, that&rsquo;s terrible! They&rsquo;re gonna be crushed!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why would they think they&rsquo;re invited?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (looking around) You got me. I don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y&rsquo;know? Your parents are comin&rsquo;! Chandler&rsquo;s parents are comin&rsquo;! Ross&rsquo;s parents are comin&rsquo;!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross&rsquo;s parents are <b>my</b> parents!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well-well&mdash;see? Parents are comin&rsquo;!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know I think we should invite them.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh please, you just want more blue pins.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well this is just sad!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That is not a problem.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (leaning down to her) Maybe you&rsquo;ll order a little sangria?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: <i>Ralph Lauren</i>, Rachel is showing Chandler the selection of tuxedos.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there&rsquo;s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, thanks a lot for hookin&rsquo; me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m Monica&rsquo;s maid of honor. Okay? Don&rsquo;t try to blue pin me!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (sees another rack) Well, what&rsquo;s the deal with these? These-these look nice.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they&rsquo;re done with them they just send &lsquo;em back.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You mean like for award shows?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Some of them.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, &ldquo;Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, might I suggest watching a little more <i>ESPN</i> and a little less <i>E!</i>?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, well let&rsquo;s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Not bad.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O&rsquo;Neil.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, <i>ESPN</i>! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pierce Brosnan?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you serious?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> 007?! This is James Bond&rsquo;s tux?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I have to get married in James Bond&rsquo;s tux!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&rsquo;s a pretty cool tux.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s not just that, I would be England&rsquo;s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty&rsquo;s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Joey and Rachel&rsquo;s, Joey and Phoebe are moving chess pieces around on the board and hitting the timer at random.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey&rsquo;s like in Checkers.) Chess!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Nice move.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So Joey, I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding: do you need one?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, I&rsquo;m performing the ceremony. I&rsquo;m not wearing a tux.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what are you going to wear?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh. Does Monica know about this?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, y&rsquo;know what? I can&rsquo;t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (excitedly) Can I come?! I won&rsquo;t even talk! You&rsquo;ll just hear the noise from my video camera.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What is this? What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey&rsquo;s lewd version?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Joey&rsquo;s!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time&hellip;she and I y&rsquo;know&hellip;kissed a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (laughs) Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure that happened.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It-it did!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Sure!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey. (Laughs, then seriously) It happened!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Why are you taking this away from me?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay! I just&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey smiles and nods lewdly.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m not saying that I&rsquo;m a lesbian! I&rsquo;m just saying that this happened!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you&rsquo;re so&mdash;y&rsquo;know so&hellip;vanilla.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (shocked) Vanilla?!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m not vanilla! I&rsquo;ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> To Ross.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, y&rsquo;know what? If you don&rsquo;t want to believe me about this, why don&rsquo;t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay! All right! Yeah! &lsquo;Cause I just can&rsquo;t picture it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch reading as Ross enters carrying a garment bag.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman&rsquo;s tux!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film&hellip;that Batman film he was in.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can&rsquo;t wear that! I&rsquo;m wearing the famous tux! James Bond&rsquo;s tux!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So&mdash;If you wear that you&rsquo;ll make mine less special.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! <b>You</b> are marrying the woman you love.</p>
<p>(Chandler mimics him.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Please, don&rsquo;t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look, it&rsquo;s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> When I got married you slept with my sister.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> <b>That</b> was pretty 007.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s, Monica is still working on the seating chart as Joey enters.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey. Oh good-good you&rsquo;re here! All right, I figured it out. I&rsquo;m gonna take two tables of eight, I&rsquo;m gonna add your parents, and I&rsquo;m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, they&rsquo;re not coming.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (looking at him) What?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They&hellip;feel a little unwanted.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh that&rsquo;s too bad. It&rsquo;s true, but too bad.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look Mon, if you could just call my mom&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh Joey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Come on! Look just-just tell&mdash;let her know that you really want them to be there. Let&rsquo;s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No she hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Is it her fault that some of them didn&rsquo;t make it to you?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, what am I going to say?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. Just uh, just tell &lsquo;em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or&mdash;No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They <b>hate</b> the post office. And the Irish! But I don&rsquo;t think you can blame it on them, so&hellip; (He dials the phone and hands it to Monica.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I&rsquo;m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren&rsquo;t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What, are they Irish?! (Joey gives her a thumbs up.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A restaurant, Melissa, Rachel, and Phoebe are talking.</h3>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> &hellip;anyway, his name is Allan and we&rsquo;ve been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh. Oh, that&rsquo;s great!</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> What one?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Y&rsquo;know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> Oh, isn&rsquo;t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch? (Phoebe agrees by grunting.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin&rsquo; Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> (shocked) What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Remember?! We&mdash;come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> &hellip;we went back to the house and we got really silly and we&hellip;we made out.</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Really?!</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s, Monica is on the couch as Chandler disgustedly enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ross is Batman!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Batman has a utility belt!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> 007 has a fancy car!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Batman has the Batmobile!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> 007 gets all the ladies.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get <i>ESPN</i> right?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I&rsquo;ll make you a nice martini.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Actually, I don&rsquo;t like martinis.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> How about a <i>Youhoo</i> with a funny straw?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> The show?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Have you ever been to one of <b>my</b> weddings?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it&rsquo;s the same day as my niece&rsquo;s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. &lsquo;Cause my part&rsquo;s just in the beginning I&rsquo;m not even in the rest of the show&mdash;Wedding!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> The wedding starts at six.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little &lsquo;til they get there?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You&rsquo;ll vamp?!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah! Yeah y&rsquo;know, like warm up the crowd. Ask &lsquo;em where they&rsquo;re from. &lsquo;Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister <b>and</b> you get an entertainer. I&rsquo;m a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no-one better! There is no-one greater!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The restaurant, continued from earlier.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> How can you not remember us kissing?!</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t remember a lot of things that never happened.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wh&hellip; Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn&rsquo;t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin&rsquo; together?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, somewhere Joey&rsquo;s head is exploding.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah&mdash;but come on&mdash;Listen, I&rsquo;m sorry I don&rsquo;t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn&rsquo;t believe me.</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No!!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Rachel, it&rsquo;s okay. You don&rsquo;t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> She didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s, Monica and Chandler are working on the seating chart as Ross enters carrying his tux around.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You just carry that around?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Between you and&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don&rsquo;t we put them on? Y&rsquo;know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I would but mine doesn&rsquo;t fit. The pants are a little tight.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> A little tight? I could see double-oh <b>and</b> seven in those pants.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, does that mean that you&rsquo;re not going to be wearing yours?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What, are you kidding? It&rsquo;s Batman&rsquo;s tux!!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (standing up) Let me try it on!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin&rsquo; in there.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) What&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> An invitation for the <i>At First Sight</i> premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn&rsquo;t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right that&rsquo;s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom to stand at the altar and scream racial slurs? I don&rsquo;t care!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They&rsquo;re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (defeated) Oh.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you&rsquo;re welcome. And tell them we&rsquo;re really glad they&rsquo;re coming.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Outside the restaurant, Melissa, Phoebe, and Rachel are emerging.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It happened! I am telling you it happened!</p>
<p><b>Melissa:</b> Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, y&rsquo;know you&rsquo;ve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys.</p>
<p>(She&rsquo;s about to get in when&hellip;)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, <b>that</b> night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I&rsquo;m <b>not</b> gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don&rsquo;t remember that, <b>maybe</b> you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)</p>
