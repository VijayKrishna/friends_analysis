<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross is eyeing a beautiful woman at the counter, and Joey and Chandler are egging him on to go talk to her. No pun intended. I mean it.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you Ross, she wants you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Any contact?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She lent me an egg once.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You&rsquo;re in!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Aw, right.</p>
<p><b>Woman:</b> Hi, Ross.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey. (stutters something incoherent)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing&rsquo;s not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think we need a third&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> An egg?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna go up to her and say, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your egg back, I&rsquo;m returning your egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think it&rsquo;s winning.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I think it&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> She&rsquo;ll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.</p>
<p>(Ross walks over to the woman, egg in hand.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Think it&rsquo;ll work?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, it&rsquo;s suicide. The man&rsquo;s got an egg.</p>

<h3>Opening Credits</h3>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You can not do this.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do what, do what?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Phoebes! Don&rsquo;t you remember why you dumped the guy?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> &rsquo;Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening&hellip; alright, still, it&rsquo;s nice to have a date on Valentine&rsquo;s Day!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, uh, listen, about tonight&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, no, don&rsquo;t you dare bail on me. The only reason she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Pathetic mess? I know, but&mdash;come on, man, she&rsquo;s needy, she&rsquo;s vulnerable. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;, cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; this.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi. She said yes.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross&rsquo; shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Restaurant, Joey and Chandler are there, waiting for their dates to show up.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, uh, I&hellip; don&rsquo;t&hellip; care. (Joey&rsquo;s date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.</p>
<p><b>Lorraine:</b> Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> &hellip;And what did you bring?</p>
<p><b>Lorraine:</b> She&rsquo;s checking the coats. Joey, I&rsquo;m gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Janice?</p>
<p>(Lorraine leaves. Joey shakes his head as though to say, &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be the same Janice.&rsquo; Janice enters.)</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh&hellip; my&hellip; God.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (angrily) Hey, it&rsquo;s Janice.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The bathroom at the restaurant, Chandler and Joey are talking.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, I&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; a break for it, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; out the window.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, no, don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ve been waitin&rsquo; for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I&rsquo;ve dumped twice in the last five months!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin&rsquo;? You&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; me nervous, and I can&rsquo;t go when I&rsquo;m nervous.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry, you&rsquo;re right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, the girls are all there, discussing their bad luck with men.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Which one was Pete Carney?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) &ldquo;Was it good for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, well, I&rsquo;ll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-&rdquo;I-win&rdquo;-guy. (imitating) &ldquo;I win! I win!&rdquo; I went out with the guy for two months&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t get to win once.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> How did we end up with these jerks? We&rsquo;re good people!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe we&rsquo;re some kinda magnets.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I know I am. That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t wear a digital watch.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> There&rsquo;s more beer, right?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day. It&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, well, what kind of ritual?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Or?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Or&hellip;or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Burning&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Burning&rsquo;s good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Restaurant, Joey, Lorraine, Chandler, and Janice are at the table. Joey and Lorraine are seated very close, Chandler and Janice have backed their chairs away from one another.</h3>
<p><b>Lorraine:</b> You know, ever since I was little, I&rsquo;ve been able to pick up quarters with my toes.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.</p>
<p>(Lorraine whispers into Joey&rsquo;s ear.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Lorraine) We can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (disgusted) What? What can&rsquo;t you do?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?</p>
<p>(Chandler and Joey leave the table.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, we might be leaving now.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Tell me it&rsquo;s &ldquo;you and me&rdquo; we.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I&rsquo;m not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, you can not do this to me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;m sorry. You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p><b>Lorraine:</b> (to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;m outta here. Here&rsquo;s my credit card. Dinner&rsquo;s on me. I&rsquo;m sorry, Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I hope she throws up on you.</p>
<p>(Joey leaves with Lorraine. Chandler sits back down with Janice.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Just us.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, what a crappy night!</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt&rsquo;s been stickin&rsquo; outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up&hellip; other patrons look at him) How ya doin&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> So, do we have the best friends or what?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Joey&rsquo;s not a friend. He&rsquo;s&hellip;a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> I will go for that drink.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it&rsquo;s a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Each.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I&rsquo;ve always wanted to know&hellip;</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler&rsquo;s bedroom, Chandler wakes up, and finds someone else&rsquo;s hand on his chest. He rolls over and is shocked to see Janice there.</h3>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Happy Valentine&rsquo;s Day!</p>

<h3>Commercial Break</h3>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Hallway, Chandler is trying to get Janice out of his apartment.</h3>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No&hellip; no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Kiss me!</p>
<p>(Janice kisses him. Monica comes out for the newspaper.}</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Chandler, sorry.</p>
<p>(Janice turns around, Monica sees who it is.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Hi, Monica.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, well, this was very special.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, come see who&rsquo;s out here!</p>
<p>(Rachel comes out.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my god. Janice, hi!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Janice is gonna go away now.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>
<p>(Joey enters from the stairs.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, Joey, look who it is.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (in disbelief) Whoa.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, good, Joey&rsquo;s home now.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.</p>
<p>(Monica comes out with her cordless phone.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There&rsquo;s someone I want you to say hi to. (to Chandler) He just happened to call.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Hi, Ross. Yes, it&rsquo;s me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Chinese Restaurant, Ross is there with his date.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m just sayin&rsquo; if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn&rsquo;t just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.</p>
<p>(Ross starts to laugh, and then makes a face like &lsquo;Why did I just say that?&rsquo; Ross&rsquo; ex-wife, Carol, and her lesbian lover, Susan, enter the restaurant. Ross stares at them.)</p>
<p><b>Kristin:</b> That&rsquo;s funny. Who are they?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her&hellip; close, personal friend.</p>
<p><b>Kristin:</b> You mean they&rsquo;re lovers.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> If you wanna put a label on it.</p>
<p><b>Kristin:</b> Wow, uh, anything else I should know?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Nope, nope, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>(Carol takes off her jacket, her pregnant belly is exposed.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, and she&rsquo;s pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, the girls are holding their boyfriend bonfire.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All I have is, is oregano and a <em>Fresca</em>.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, that&rsquo;s ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn&rsquo;t be doing the ritual in the first place.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Can we just start throwing things in?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry&rsquo;s letters. Adam Ritter&rsquo;s boxer shorts.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Look, here&rsquo;s a picture of Scotty Jared naked.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looking at picture) Hey he&rsquo;s wearing a sweater.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Rachel and Phoebe:</b> Eww!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> And here we have the last of Paulo&rsquo;s grappa.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Rachel, isn&rsquo;t that stuff almost pure&hellip;</p>
<p>(Rachel throws the alcohol in the fire. A burst of flames shoots up from it.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are there. Chandler is preparing to dump Janice again.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> How can I dump this woman on Valentine&rsquo;s day?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. You dumped her on New Year&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, man. In my next life, I&rsquo;m coming back as a toilet brush.</p>
<p>(Janice enters.)</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Hello, funny Valentine.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi, Just Janice.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I&rsquo;m gonna!</p>
<p>(Janice kisses Joey all over. Chandler smiles.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Chandler) If you don&rsquo;t do it, I will.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Chinese Restaurant.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So, um, what do you do for a living?</p>
<p><b>Kristin:</b> Well, um, for the past few years I&rsquo;ve been working..(Ross is watching Carol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left stranded)&hellip;which is funny because, that wasn&rsquo;t even my major.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.</p>
<p><b>Susan:</b> I thought they could&hellip;I&rsquo;ll try to get back as soon as I can. I&rsquo;m sorry. (Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Now that is funny. Hey, do you think&hellip;would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? &rsquo;Cause she&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.</p>
<p><b>Kristin:</b> (reluctantly) I guess.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh, no no no. I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on. These people&rsquo;ll scooch down. You guys&rsquo;ll scooch, won&rsquo;t you? Let&rsquo;s try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin&hellip;(struggling)&hellip;does something that, funnily enough, wasn&rsquo;t even her major!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, firemen are there to handle the bonfire that got out of control.</h3>
<p><b>Fireman No. 1:</b> What do we got there?</p>
<p><b>Fireman No. 2:</b> A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture&mdash;Wow, that guy&rsquo;s hairier than the Chief!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, it&rsquo;s a really funny story how this happened.</p>
<p><b>Fireman No. 3:</b> It&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s all right. You don&rsquo;t have to explain. This isn&rsquo;t the first boyfriend bonfire that we&rsquo;ve seen get out of control.</p>
<p><b>Fireman No. 1:</b> You&rsquo;re our third call tonight.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Fireman No. 2:</b> Oh, sure, Valentine&rsquo;s is our busiest night of the year.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk.</h3>
<p><b>Janice:</b> I brought you something.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> I had them made special.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there&rsquo;s no way for me to tell you this. At least there&rsquo;s no <b>new</b> way for me to tell you this. I just don&rsquo;t things are gonna work out.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (surprised) It is?</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn&rsquo;t the end.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no, you see, actually it is.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> No, it isn&rsquo;t, because you won&rsquo;t let that happen. Don&rsquo;t you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, no I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year&rsquo;s? Who invited who? Valentine&rsquo;s? Who asked who into whose bed?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I did, but&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Janice:</b> You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can&rsquo;t live without me. And you know it. You just don&rsquo;t know you know it. See ya.</p>
<p>(She kisses him passionately,then leaves.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Call me!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Chinese Restaurant, Ross and Carol are talking. Kristin is not there.</h3>
<p><b>Carol:</b> It&rsquo;s not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You did so. I swear, I swear&mdash;(noticing Kristin&rsquo;s absence) How long has she been in the bathroom?</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Uh, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well maybe it&rsquo;s cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> That could be it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.)</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Mushroom. Smile. They won&rsquo;t all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that&rsquo;s not funny</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;you know the whole &ldquo;getting on with your life&rdquo; thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I&rsquo;m sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she&rsquo;s perfectly nice, and, but that there&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s it. And um, and then I&rsquo;m here talkin&rsquo; to you, and, and it&rsquo;s easy, and it&rsquo;s fun, and, and I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t have to&hellip;You know, here&rsquo;s a wacky thought. Um, what&rsquo;s say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you&rsquo;re gonna say, you&rsquo;re a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let&rsquo;s just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we&rsquo;re great together, you know. You can&rsquo;t deny it. Besides, you&rsquo;re carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin&rsquo; that, but there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; right here. I love you.</p>
<p>(They kiss.)</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Oh, I love you too. But&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No but, no but.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It&rsquo;s time to take the pin out. You&rsquo;ll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s easy for you to say, you found one already.</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> All you need is a woman who likes men and you&rsquo;ll be set.</p>
<p>(A beautiful woman walks by Ross, he stares at her.)</p>
<p><b>Carol:</b> Not her.</p>
