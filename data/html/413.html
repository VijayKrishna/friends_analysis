<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Theatre, Chandler and Ross are there to watch the premiere of Kathy&rsquo;s play.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is <b>my</b> girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> People can hear you.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know!!</p>
<p>(The play starts.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow! She looks great. Doesn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p>(Onstage there&rsquo;s a knock on the door and Kathy opens it. We don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s going on, only hear it.)</p>
<p><b>Kathy&rsquo;s Co-Star:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That is one good looking man!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!</p>
<p><b>Kathy&rsquo;s Co-Star:</b> Sooo, you&rsquo;ve been doing this long?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> No, you&rsquo;re my first. Put the money on the table.</p>
<p>(Ross and Chandler have stunned looks on their faces as Kathy and her co-star start making out.)</p>
<p><b>Kathy&rsquo;s Co-Star:</b> Oh, yeah! Ooh, that&rsquo;s nice. (They start making out harder.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Dude!</p>
<p><b>Kathy&rsquo;s Co-Star:</b> Is that an expensive blouse?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> If you want it to be.</p>
<p>(Kathy&rsquo;s co-star rips her blouse off and buttons go flying into the audience, and one hits Ross. Chandler&rsquo;s mouth is on the floor.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Here&rsquo;s your girlfriend&rsquo;s button. (Holding the button.)</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, erm, Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Monica is still unpacking after the move, and Phoebe is their also.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it&rsquo;s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.</p>
<p>(Rachel enters)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just&hellip;(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)&hellip;throw your purses at it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> <em>Bloomingdale&rsquo;s </em>eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, are you out of a job?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a <b>huge</b> step down!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That sounds great!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can&rsquo;t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (Holding a turkey leg) There&rsquo;s gravy?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that&rsquo;s your department now. (She takes back the turkey leg)</p>
<p>(Joey climbs up on the counter and starts looking at the top of the cabinets.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I think I left a donut up here.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are entering after the play. Phoebe and Joey are already there.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! How was Kathy&rsquo;s play?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin&rsquo; guy.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s like someone <b>literally</b> wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> <b>That&rsquo;s</b> a good idea for a business!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they&rsquo;re gonna go to their cast parties and he&rsquo;s gonna try to undermine me. Y&rsquo;know it&rsquo;ll be like, &ldquo;So where&rsquo;s your boyfriend, what&rsquo;s-his-name, Chester?&rdquo; And she&rsquo;ll go, &ldquo;No-no-no, it&rsquo;s Chandler.&rdquo; And he&rsquo;ll go, &ldquo;Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler, look they&rsquo;re actors. They&rsquo;re there to do a job, just &lsquo;cause they work together, doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re gonna get together. I mean just &lsquo;cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s gonna happen with them.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> They&rsquo;re not a couple!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh-okay, I get the game now.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well okay, so then you&rsquo;re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it&rsquo;s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It&rsquo;s when the heat goes away, that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, you guys have been to every play I&rsquo;ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Noooo!!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, erm, Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, the gang minus Monica and Rachel are eating breakfast. Ross and Chandler are sitting at the foosball table and eating.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&rsquo;know what, I don&rsquo;t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know but&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no-no-no, I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You made pancakes?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yep! Grab a plate.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her pancakes.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin&rsquo; closer.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, okay, but don&rsquo;t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, <b>and</b>, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I&rsquo;m fairly certain are the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Listen also we&rsquo;re uh, we&rsquo;re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yeah!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah, who&rsquo;s playing?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> The players.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) Please, it&rsquo;s a relief is what it is, is what it is.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her plate.)</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: <em>Bloomingdale&rsquo;s</em>, Rachel&rsquo;s new job.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (on the phone) Monica, I&rsquo;m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn&rsquo;t even buy it! (Pause) I&rsquo;m telling you I&rsquo;m quitting! That&rsquo;s it! I&rsquo;m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> In a moment, please, I&rsquo;m in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.</p>
<p>(It&rsquo;s a really good-looking man, Joshua, that Rachel has an instant crush on. Well actually it&rsquo;s Tate Donovan, so it&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;s really testing her acting skills.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Hi, I&rsquo;m Joshua.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi, I&rsquo;m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my <b>ex</b>-wife&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>(He walks over to look and some clothes and Rachel quickly turns around and adjusts her bra, trying to show off her assets.)</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, at least that&rsquo;s a great suit.</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah, but it wasn&rsquo;t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if you&rsquo;re willing, I&rsquo;m all yours.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Rachel, you needed to speak to me?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No-no, that wasn&rsquo;t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.</p>
<p>(He walks out and Rachel stares at his butt as he leaves. He makes a wrong turn.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh, sorry, it&rsquo;s this way, it&rsquo;s this way. (Motions to the correct way.)</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> It&rsquo;s this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his butt.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Kathy&rsquo;s play, Ross and Chandler are waiting for her in the lobby after the play.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there&rsquo;s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> All right, let&rsquo;s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Here she comes. Don&rsquo;t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don&rsquo;t be&hellip;y&rsquo;know you.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Hey you guys!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Wasn&rsquo;t Nick funny when he couldn&rsquo;t get his match lit?</p>
<p>(Chandler laughs without opening his mouth.)</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> It&rsquo;s a good play, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>(Chandler mumbles something, and Ross tells him to &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and <b>Nick</b> ditto. Clearly you&rsquo;re having sex with him.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I&hellip; (Walks away.)</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Clearly, I&rsquo;m having sex with him?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Okay, so let me just get this straight. You&rsquo;re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I-I could see how this could happen, y&rsquo;know you&rsquo;re up there every night, you&rsquo;re naked, touching, kissing.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, you can understand, given how we started.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh, wow. I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re throwing that in my face.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that is what happened, and I don&rsquo;t even see you denying this!</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Chandler, why don&rsquo;t you call me when you grow up!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, well, don&rsquo;t expect <b>that</b> to happen anytime soon!</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, erm, Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey, Phoebe, and Ross are there eating pizza as Rachel enters.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Rachel has a new doll.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-<b>u</b>-a! Joshua! Josh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, hello!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi-e!!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, what do I smell?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, it smells good.</p>
<p>(He goes over and opens the door to reveal Monica holding a plate of cookies and a fan to blow the smell across the hall.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Please, have some!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yumm!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new <em>Playboy</em>!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, it&rsquo;s just something I picked up.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Cookies and porn, you&rsquo;re the best mom ever!!</p>
<p>(Rachel laughs hysterically for no reason.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What? What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> It&rsquo;s Joshua.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. Joey follows him)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait! Wait! This isn&rsquo;t take-out!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, wait, please don&rsquo;t go! I&rsquo;ve got porn for you too!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> People are supposed to wanna hang out here!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why? Honey, what is the big deal?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m the hostess! Not those guys! I&rsquo;m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y&rsquo;know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> &lsquo;Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m done now. They&rsquo;ve suffered enough.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> If you wanted to punish them, you should&rsquo;ve just made them hang out here!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right then, when I&rsquo;m done with this place, it&rsquo;s gonna be ten times better than that place!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, are we gonna trash that place?</p>
<p>(Chandler comes back, obviously drunk, and trips over the steps.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new <em>Playboy</em>) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the <em>Playboy </em>behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl&rsquo;s apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> What?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So you were right?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I confronted her, and she didn&rsquo;t deny it! (Pause) I don&rsquo;t live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler, what did she say?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wait a minute.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Come here.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you sure?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to <em>Beefsteak Julie&rsquo;s</em>&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> <em>Beefsteak Charlie&rsquo;s</em>?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes! See you and I have always been like&mdash;(motions that they think the same.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The hallway between the apartments, Monica is lugging one of those floor polishing machines through the hallway. Rachel comes up the steps and stops when she sees Monica.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s.) Oh, hey, do you need help with that?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Nah, I got it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s.)</p>
<p>[Cut to inside the apartment.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It&rsquo;s just so frustrating!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Why don&rsquo;t you ask him out?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, yeah, totally! That&rsquo;s such a turn-on!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really? It doesn&rsquo;t seem desperate?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-ooh, that&rsquo;s the turn-on.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He just got a divorce right?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hmm-mmm.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So he&rsquo;s probably really nervous around women, y&rsquo;know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah but, I&rsquo;ve never asked a guy out before.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (shocked) You&rsquo;ve never asked a guy out?!!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Have you?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thousands of times!! That doesn&rsquo;t make me sound too good does it?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don&rsquo;t even know how I would go about it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, &ldquo;Hey, how you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, please!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin&rsquo;?</p>
<p>(Phoebe looks at him, and then giggles and looks away.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> You know what, I&rsquo;m gonna do that, I&rsquo;m gonna call him up, and I&rsquo;m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin&rsquo;? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It&rsquo;s Rachel Green from <em>Bloomingdale&rsquo;s</em>. (Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found <b>a</b> wallet, and we&mdash;(Listens) the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let&rsquo;s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You&rsquo;ve done that a thousand times?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;ve never done that.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, you gotta give him something that he can&rsquo;t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you&rsquo;re guaranteed he&rsquo;ll say yes!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?! You think that will work?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Absolutely! And if it doesn&rsquo;t, can I get the extra ticket?</p>
<p>(We hear a noise coming from Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s apartment.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What the heck is that?</p>
<p>(They go open the door and reveal Monica being spun around on the floor polisher and getting the cord wrapped around her legs.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, erm, Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Ross, Joey, and Phoebe are watching a movie as Chandler comes in from his bedroom.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Did she call?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, sorry.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, maybe I should call her.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> No! Forget her, man! You don&rsquo;t need her, you don&rsquo;t need that!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> He&rsquo;s right, what she did was unforgivable.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, yeah, but y&rsquo;know, what-what if I was wrong?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> How might you be wrong?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well y&rsquo;know, what if she didn&rsquo;t actually sleep with the guy?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Dude, tell me she actually told you this.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re basing this on?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There&rsquo;s a lot of theories that didn&rsquo;t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh my God!!</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: <em>Bloomingdale&rsquo;s</em>, Rachel&rsquo;s new job, she is waiting for Joshua and practising how to ask him out.]</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too&hellip; (Tries again.) Umm, who likes the Knicks&mdash;(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> What do you think?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the mirror.) Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like it?</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I&rsquo;m gonna wear it home.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Great.</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> All right, thank you so much for all your help.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah-eah-ha!</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Thanks. (He starts to leave) Maybe I&rsquo;ll see in the spring, with the uh, y&rsquo;know, for the uh, bathing suits.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh well, you don&rsquo;t want to do that now?!</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Ah, that&rsquo;s okay, thanks.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Anyway, hopefully, I&rsquo;ll see you around sometime. (He goes out the door.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Basketball!</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> (coming back in) I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you&rsquo;re interested, just as a thank you for this week.</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Wow! That would be great.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr. Waltham returns.)</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Good morning.</p>
<p><b>Joshua:</b> Hi!</p>
<p>(Mr. Waltham admires Joshua&rsquo;s butt as he leaves.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Kathy&rsquo;s apartment, Chandler is knocking on the door.</h3>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> (opening the door) Hey.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I&rsquo;m sorry. Y&rsquo;know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Oh wow. I really wish you&rsquo;d call me.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y&rsquo;know I-I think this is a good thing. Y&rsquo;know? &lsquo;Cause we&rsquo;ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y&rsquo;know, I know for me&mdash;(Notices a pair of men&rsquo;s pants on the chair.) Nick&rsquo;s pants?</p>
<p><b>Kathy:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a <b>big</b> one!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, erm, Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is debriefing Rachel on her rejection earlier that day and telling her what she should&rsquo;ve done. Ross and Phoebe are watching.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, for next time, what do you say?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> He didn&rsquo;t turn me down! He&rsquo;s at the game isn&rsquo;t he? I got the date, I&rsquo;m just not on it!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Okay, it&rsquo;s ready. Come on.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What&rsquo;s ready?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Just come.</p>
<p>(They all go over to her apartment.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! Monica!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Great!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> This is beautiful!</p>
<p>(She has cleaned it, completely redecorated it, removed the carpet, and polished the floor.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh did you&mdash;what did you&mdash;did you work for two days straight?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, it looks the same.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You used to have carpet.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I&rsquo;m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I&rsquo;m always the hostess.</p>
<p>(Chandler returns.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> How&rsquo;d it go?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, she wasn&rsquo;t sleeping with him.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh good!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> She is now.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What are you saying?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m saying that she&hellip; is a devil woman! Y&rsquo;know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I <b>hate</b> her! Well, I don&rsquo;t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How? How is your fault?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Because, I-I should&rsquo;ve called! Y&rsquo;know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would&rsquo;ve gone out with Nick, and they would&rsquo;ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, if-if she thought they were on a break&hellip;</p>
<p>(They all turn and glare at him.)</p>

<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waltham:</b> Will you call him?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in <em>Spaceballs</em>, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I&rsquo;m glad. Rachel, I&rsquo;d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin&rsquo;?</p>
