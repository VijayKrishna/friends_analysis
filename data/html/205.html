<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Ross and Chandler are there. Ross is watching wrestling.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Man, I sure miss Julie.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. (The phone rings and Chandler doesn&rsquo;t answer it.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> You ever figure out what that thing&rsquo;s for?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, see, I&rsquo;m trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I&rsquo;m always answering the phone, people&rsquo;ll think I don&rsquo;t have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.</p>
<p><b>Machine:</b> (Joey&rsquo;s voice) Here comes the beep, you know what to do.</p>
<p><b>Woman&rsquo;s Voice:</b> Hello, I&rsquo;m looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it&rsquo;s been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> I got a little drunk&hellip;and naked.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (answering the phone, in a deep voice) Bob here.</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, continued from earlier. Ross and Chandler are dancing.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone) What&rsquo;ve you been up to?</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. (They stop dancing.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (To Ross) I love her.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I know.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (on phone) I&rsquo;m back.</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> So, are we gonna get together or what?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Um, absolutely. Uh, how &lsquo;bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Great, I&rsquo;ll see you then.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok. (He hangs up.) Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; when she sees you tomorow, she&rsquo;s probably gonna realize, &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re not Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m hoping that when Bob doesn&rsquo;t show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my god. You are pure evil.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, pure evil (holds up his left hand), horny and alone (holds up his right hand). I&rsquo;ve done this (He shakes his right hand.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, everyone is there and Ross is on the phone.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, yeah, everybody&rsquo;s here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hi, Julie!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (sarcastically) Hi, Julie.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, is, is there any chance that you&rsquo;re rounding up? Y&rsquo;know, like from, like 20?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Do we need a cake?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Look guys, I know it&rsquo;s a little steep.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, whoosh! (Imitates going over a cliff with her hand.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> But it&rsquo;s Ross.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> It&rsquo;s Ross.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;ll see you guys later, I gotta go&hellip;do a thing.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, sweetheart, I&rsquo;ll call you later tonight. (He hangs up) (To Chandler) Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you&rsquo;re not really gonna go through with this, are you?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know, I think I might just.</p>
<p>(They exit.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well I guess I gotta start savin&rsquo; up for Ross&rsquo;s birthday, so I guess I&rsquo;ll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don&rsquo;t get that we don&rsquo;t make as much money as they do?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes! Yeah, it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re always saying &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go here, let&rsquo;s go there&rdquo;. Like we can afford to go here and there.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yes, yes, and it&rsquo;s, and we always have to go to, y&rsquo;know, someplace nice, y&rsquo;know? God, and it&rsquo;s not like we can say anything about it, &rsquo;cause, like this birthday thing, it&rsquo;s for Ross.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> For Ross.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> For Ross, Ross, Ross.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Oh my god.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;m at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> If it&rsquo;s not you, this is a horrible story.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. Y&rsquo;know, someplace nice. (She goes into her bedroom.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, someplace nice.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> How much do you think I can get for my kidney?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Jade is waiting for Bob to show while Ross and Chandler look on.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you. You can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That doesn&rsquo;t matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people&rsquo;s chance for happiness.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We don&rsquo;t know Bob! Okay? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Go over there and tell that woman the truth.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right. (He gets up, but swings around the pole back to their table.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Go.</p>
<p>(He walks over to Jade.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Yes?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoever stood you up is a jerk.</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> How did you&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. (He sits down.) I just had this weird sense. You know, but that&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;m weird and sensitive. Tissue? (Holds out one of this small packs.)</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, you keep the pack. I&rsquo;m all cried out today.</p>
<p>(He looks over at Ross who glares at him.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> A Restaurant, everyone except Chandler is seated at a table.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, (holding up his glass) ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Who is also in charge of purchasing.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Who has her own little desk when Roland&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland&rsquo;s not there. Here&rsquo;s to my little sister&mdash;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Cool.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Let&rsquo;s see!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ll-I&rsquo;ll just wait!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, sorry.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Sorry, sorry.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica!</p>
<p>(They clink their glasses.)</p>
<p><b>Waiter:</b> Are we ready to order?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, you know what, we haven&rsquo;t even looked yet.</p>
<p><b>Waiter:</b> Well, when you do, just let me know. I&rsquo;ll be right over there on the edge of my seat.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (to Joey and Rachel) Wow, look at these prices.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> What are these, like famous chickens?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, sorry I&rsquo;m late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I&rsquo;m not sorry I&rsquo;m late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (to Chandler behind their menus) Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn&rsquo;t tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob&rsquo;s number.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?</p>
<p><b>Waiter:</b> Do I dare ask?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I&rsquo;ll have the grilled prawns.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That sounds great. Same for me.</p>
<p><b>Waiter:</b> And for the gentleman?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I&rsquo;ll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?</p>
<p><b>Waiter:</b> You&rsquo;d think, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Miss?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad.</p>
<p><b>Waiter:</b> (whispers) And what will that be on the side of?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh, I don&rsquo;t know. Why don&rsquo;t you put it right here next to my water?</p>
<p><b>Waiter:</b> And for you?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Um, I&rsquo;m gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.</p>
<p><b>Waiter:</b> Anything else?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, how &lsquo;bout a verse of <em>Killing Me Softly</em>. You&rsquo;re gonna sneeze on my fish, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>[Time lapse, everyone has finished dinner and Ross is figuring out the bill.]</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, everyone?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, you&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica&rsquo;s big night, she shouldn&rsquo;t pay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, thank you!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, huh uh, no way, I&rsquo;m sorry, not gonna happen.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, Monica, I&rsquo;m really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that-that-that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, Pheebs! How &lsquo;bout we&rsquo;ll each just pay for what we had. It&rsquo;s no big deal.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Not for you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (to Joey and Phoebe) Ok, look you guys, I really don&rsquo;t want to get into this right now. I think it&rsquo;ll just make everyone uncomfortable.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine. All right, fine.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> You can tell us.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hello, it&rsquo;s us, all right? It&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (clearing his throat a lot) Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don&rsquo;t get that uh&hellip; (Pause) We don&rsquo;t have as much money as you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I hear ya.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> We can talk about that.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, then&hellip;Let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well umm I, I just never think of money as an issue.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause you have it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So um, how come you guys haven&rsquo;t talked about this before?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> &rsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s always somethin&rsquo;, you know, like with Monica&rsquo;s new job, or the whole Ross&rsquo;s birthday hoopla.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wha&mdash;Whoa, hey, I don&rsquo;t want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative&mdash;there&rsquo;s gonna be a hoopla?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Basically, there&rsquo;s the thing, and then there&rsquo;s the stuff after the thing.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we&rsquo;ll just do the gift.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> G-gift? The thing&rsquo;s not the gift?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hootie and the&mdash;oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, look, hey, it&rsquo;s my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All of us.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Together.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Not at the concert.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p>(An awkward silence ensues.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, the ebola virus. That&rsquo;s gotta suck, huh?</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Joey, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting in the living room as Monica, who&rsquo;s holding a bag, Ross, and Chandler stand before them.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Gee, Monica, what&rsquo;s in the bag?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&rsquo;t know, Chandler. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s like a skit.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Why, it&rsquo;s dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoo!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Cool.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> But wait, there&rsquo;s more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to the others) By the way, this didn&rsquo;t seem so dorky in the hall.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why, it&rsquo;s six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! (Pause) The Blowfish!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> It&rsquo;s on us, all right, so don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s our treat.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So&hellip;Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Could you be less enthused?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, it&rsquo;s a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Like?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Charity.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Charity?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> We&rsquo;re just tryin&rsquo; to do a nice thing here.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big. (Holds her thumb and forefinger a short distance apart.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Actually, it makes us feel that big. (She squeezes Rachel&rsquo;s thumb and forefinger closer together.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t understand. I mean, you, it&rsquo;s like we can&rsquo;t win with you guys.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> If you guys feel this big (imitates Rachel&rsquo;s gesture), maybe that&rsquo;s not our fault. Maybe that&rsquo;s just how you feel.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, now you&rsquo;re tellin&rsquo; us how you feel.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I&rsquo;m just gonna pass on the concert, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m just not in a very Hootie place right now.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Me neither.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Me too.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Guys, we bought the tickets.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, well, then you&rsquo;ll have extra seats y&rsquo;know, for all your tiaras and stuff.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Phoebe) Why did you look at me when you said that?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, I guess now we can&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know what? You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Fine.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Fine. (Exits)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Fine.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Fine. (Exits)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Fine.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right. We&rsquo;re gonna go. (Exits, then comes back in) It&rsquo;s not for another six hours. We&rsquo;re gonna go then.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Chandler is standing at the fridge as Ross enters hiding Chandler behind the door.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Chandler!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (startling Ross) Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Geez! Are you ready?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes. Yes! Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa! You had sex today?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Now I know it&rsquo;s been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.</p>
<p>(The phone rings and Chandler doesn&rsquo;t answer it.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Still doing the screening thing?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.</p>
<p><b>Machine:</b> Here comes the beep, you know what to do.</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Hey, Bob, it&rsquo;s Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn&rsquo;t show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (answering the phone) Bob here.</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Oh, hi.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, uh, you met someone, huh?</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. (Chandler and Ross dance in joy.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, uh, how was he?</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Eh.</p>
<p>(Pause)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Eh?</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, that makes me feel so good.</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> It was just so awkward and bumpy.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (silently mouthing) Bumpy?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you&rsquo;re not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Well there really wasn&rsquo;t much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>(Chandler grimaces.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Concert, Ross, Monica, and Chandler are sitting in their seats looking at the three empty ones.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know what? I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to enjoy this.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, I know, it&rsquo;s my birthday. We all should be here.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>(They get up and start to leave, but the band starts to play.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them (the band) for us to leave now.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, the guys are probably having a great time.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Joey is trying to entertain Phoebe and Rachel.</h3>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (holding a hand behind his back) Come on you guys, one more time.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ok. One.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooo. (He brings out his hand and is holding up two fingers.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The Concert, the show has ended and everyone is starting to leave.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That was amazing!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Excellent, that was excellent.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe the guys missed this.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What guys? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Young Man:</b> Excuse me, you&rsquo;re Monica Geller aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Do I know you?</p>
<p><b>Young Man:</b> You used to be my babysitter.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How&rsquo;ve you been?</p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> Good, good, I&rsquo;m a lawyer now.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You can&rsquo;t be a lawyer. You&rsquo;re eight.</p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, wait, backstage?</p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (introducing himself) Ross.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (introducing himself) Chandler.</p>
<p><b>Steve:</b> How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey are there as Ross, Monica, and Chandler enter.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, you guys.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Happy birthday.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how&rsquo;s his dad?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Uh, good.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, we really missed you guys.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get&mdash;(notices something on Monica&rsquo;s neck)&mdash;Is that a hickey?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, I just, I fell down.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> On someone&rsquo;s lips? Where&rsquo;d you get the hickey?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You know, a party, or&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What party?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It wasn&rsquo;t so much a party as a&hellip;a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes, apparently Stevie and Hootie are like this. (Holds up crossed fingers.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Who gave you that hickey?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That would be the work of a Blowfish.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! I can&rsquo;t believe it. I can&rsquo;t believe this. We&rsquo;re just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey&rsquo;s fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, &ldquo;Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, don&rsquo;t blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?</p>
<p>(Monica&rsquo;s pager goes off)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh great, it&rsquo;s work. (To Ross) Can you hand me that? (Ross hands her the phone.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I&rsquo;m sorry that we make more money than you. But we&rsquo;re not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> And we don&rsquo;t work hard?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (on phone) Yeah, hi, it&rsquo;s Monica. I just got a page.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;m just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> And you feel like we hold you back.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No.</p>
<p>(Everyone starts bickering.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. (They quiet down.) Wait, I don&rsquo;t understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I&rsquo;ll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. (Listens) What corporate policy? (Listens) No. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) I just got fired.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh.</p>
<p>(Everyone goes over to comfort Monica)</p>
<p><b>Waitress:</b> (To Monica) Here&rsquo;s your check. That&rsquo;ll be $4.12.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (grabs the check) Let me get that. (To Chandler) You got five bucks?</p>

<h2>Closing Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s, Joey is lying on the couch as the phone rings. He&rsquo;s also screening the calls.</h3>
<p><b>Machine:</b> Here comes the beep, you know what to do.</p>
<p><b>Jade:</b> Hi, it&rsquo;s me. Listen, Bob. I&rsquo;m probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you&rsquo;re probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time&rsquo;s sake, one hot, steamy, wild night&hellip;</p>
<p>(Joey lunges for phone and misses.)</p>
