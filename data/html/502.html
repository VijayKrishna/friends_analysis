<h3><b>Scene:</b> Chandler and Joey&rsquo;s Bathroom, Chandler and Monica are sharing a candlelight bubble bath while drinking champagne and they clink their glasses.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You look cute in bubbles.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ehh, you&rsquo;re just liquored up.</p>
<p>(They move into kiss but are interrupted by Joey knocking on the door.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, it&rsquo;s me! I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; in!</p>
<p>(Monica quickly dives under the water as Joey enters. He looks a little shocked at what Chandler&rsquo;s doing.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&rsquo;ve had a very long, hard day.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Ahh, I&rsquo;m gonna go get some chicken. Want some?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>
<p>(Joey turns to leave but stops at the door.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right!</p>
<p>(Joey leaves and Monica comes up for air.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Are you okay? I&rsquo;m so sorry, he wouldn&rsquo;t leave. He kept asking me about chicken.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Chicken? I could eat some chicken.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey Joe!</p>
<p>(Monica goes back underwater as Joey re-enters.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in</p>
<p>pain as Monica grabs him underwater)-Diet Coke.</p>
<p>(Joey gives him a thumbs up and heads for the chicken.)</p>

<h2>Opening Credits</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are eating breakfast.</h3>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Mornin&rsquo; Pheebs!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh, The Wheatsheaf.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Bodington&rsquo;s!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Bodington&rsquo;s! Woohoo! (And they all high-five each other.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Ross, Bodington&rsquo;s!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! (They high-five.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> That was good beer.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;d <b>walk</b> back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Y&rsquo;know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Later! (Exits.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Isn&rsquo;t Rachel supposed to be back by now?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch) she should be here by now.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I did <b>not</b> abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I <b>had</b> to do! She&rsquo;s my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y&rsquo;know&mdash;<b>Emily</b>! Emily, is my wife! Man, what <b>is</b> that?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So you still hadn&rsquo;t heard from Emily?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No, not since I lost her at the airport.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe she can out run you man!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> <b>HEY, SHE&rsquo;s FAST!! OKAY?!!</b> (Chandler is so shocked at Ross&rsquo;s outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think <b>you</b> can be beat me? Let&rsquo;s go! Outside!!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (entering) Hi!</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Hey! (They all go hug her, except for Ross.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That&rsquo;s it? You&rsquo;re not mad? I mean, it must&rsquo;ve been terrible.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> So, what? That&rsquo;s it?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, yeah! We&rsquo;re cool. Totally cool.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, thanks. Oh, you&rsquo;re the best. (They hug.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh no, you&rsquo;re the best.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I&rsquo;m gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily&rsquo;s parent&rsquo;s house, one for each day that I&rsquo;ve known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.</p>
<p>(Ross bangs his fists together to tell Chandler off, like what was learned last season. Read about it <a href="http://thecfsi.com/season4/405jng.htm#rossthng">here</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, that&rsquo;s great! It&rsquo;s so good that you had a good time in Greece!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?! I didn&rsquo;t have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn&rsquo;t get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?&rdquo; I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it&rsquo;s all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> London is stupid! Stupid!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, you were right. I should&rsquo;ve never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh&hellip; No, I did that for someone once and I&rsquo;m not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I&rsquo;ll do it!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s fine. So Monica, <b>you</b> are now in control of my love life.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, I gotta go to work.</p>
<p>(He gets up and gives Monica a rather passionate kiss as Rachel and Phoebe look on in amazement. After the kiss ends, Chandler suddenly realizes what he just did, so he decides to do something rather rash.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.</p>
<p>(He goes over and gives Rachel the same treatment he gave Monica, only Rachel is shocked.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Chandler and Joey are there looking at pictures from the trip to London.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here&rsquo;s a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, he&rsquo;s married! Ross is married. I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I still can&rsquo;t believe it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, sweetie, by the edges.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I mean, y&rsquo;know I&rsquo;m just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of the pictures)&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> &hellip;I mean it&rsquo;s my fault.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. That&rsquo;s okay. I-I know that you&rsquo;re very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn&rsquo;t about me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to listen in.) I mean, he&rsquo;s nice, he&rsquo;s cute.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? <b>That</b> is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You&rsquo;re going to talk to him! Y&rsquo;know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you&rsquo;re going to talk to him.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, you&rsquo;re the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Say that to him and you&rsquo;re golden. (She just glares at him.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here&rsquo;s all of us at the Tower of London.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we <b>all</b> are! Yeah, there&rsquo;s Ross and Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can&rsquo;t watch.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, y&rsquo;know what, we&rsquo;ve been talking about London too much haven&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No. I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s just &rsquo;cause I couldn&rsquo;t be there. &rsquo;Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.</p>
<p><b>All:</b> Sorry.</p>
<p>(Rachel returns.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What happened?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y&rsquo;know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> See, didn&rsquo;t I tell you?! You&rsquo;re getting over Ross already!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well&hellip;</p>
<p>(Gunther goes up to the guy and holds a sign that reads, &ldquo;We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.&rdquo;)</p>
<p><b>Gunther:</b> (To the guy) Get out!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, Chandler enters to find Monica waiting patiently for him. He closes the door and they start kissing.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What took you so long?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I got caught up and work, but I&rsquo;m quitting tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, good.</p>
<p>(They start kissing and turn around so that Chandler is facing the door. And Chandler sees Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey walk in and quickly ends the kiss with Monica.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Probably some y&rsquo;know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s not European!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, it felt French.</p>
<p>(Joey is intrigued.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The hallway between the apartments, Rachel is returning from her date with Dave.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, I really had a good time!</p>
<p><b>Dave:</b> Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?</p>
<p><b>Dave:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y&rsquo;know what? I uh, I can&rsquo;t decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.</p>
<p><b>Dave:</b> Okay, yeah!</p>
<p>(She enters the apartment, leaving Dave in the hallway, to find Ross sitting on the couch with a big box.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, hi!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> She&rsquo;s doing her laundry.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What&rsquo;s that? (Points to the box.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It came in the mail today, it&rsquo;s uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I&rsquo;ve known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, honey that&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, it&rsquo;s not so bad. Monica&rsquo;s gonna make potpourri! I think I&rsquo;m gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> But, it&rsquo;s not raining.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> I can&rsquo;t catch a break!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Y&rsquo;know what Ross? You&rsquo;re not going anywhere. You&rsquo;re gonna sit right here. I&rsquo;m gonna make you a cup of tea and we&rsquo;re gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!</p>
<p><b>Dave:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, listen, I&rsquo;m gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the dropped socks.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall <b>into</b> the trap?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! <b>You</b> did not drop any socks!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I&rsquo;m calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, ultimately, I was trying y&rsquo;know, I-I wanted&hellip;tell him y&rsquo;know, that I&rsquo;m still in love with him.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (Gasps) What?!! You <b>cannot</b> tell him that!!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I make the decisions, and I say no.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y&rsquo;know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y&rsquo;know what, you&rsquo;re fired.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You can&rsquo;t fire me. <b>I</b> make <b>your</b> decisions and I say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <b>not</b> fired!&rdquo; Ha!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well&hellip; (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica&rsquo;s laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (Poking his head out.) Havin&rsquo; some trouble?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel locked the door.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> I&rsquo;ll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.</p>

<h2>Commercial Break</h2>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The hallway, continued from earlier. Monica is still locked out.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!</p>
<p>[Cut to inside the apartment, Ross decides to let Monica in and goes over and opens the door in mid-pound.]</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I really need to talk to you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, then talk!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What thing?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It&rsquo;s dangerous, she&rsquo;s never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Monica&rsquo;s right, swing dancing can be tricky. I&rsquo;m gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My God, think of the massacre.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;m gonna do it.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I&rsquo;m crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> But I&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Please!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right, fine.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s a loud bang on the door.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey, I&rsquo;m in!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there as Phoebe enters.</h3>
<p><b>All:</b> Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, okay, Pheebs?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Umm, y&rsquo;know how the other day you were talking about how you didn&rsquo;t get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh, that&rsquo;s so nice! How great! Well, where? Where&rsquo;s the trip?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central Park!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (excited) <b>Central</b>&hellip;(not so excited) Park!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, all of us! All day!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That sucks! That&rsquo;s not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s right by my house, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I&rsquo;m gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;ve been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just&mdash;y&rsquo;know&mdash;stop it!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That&rsquo;s fine, just don&rsquo;t bring it in my mouth.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, and Joey are there as Ross enters with Phoebe.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Phoebe!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, Pheebs!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, woo!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, woo! Hi.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little&hellip; Y&rsquo;know, it didn&rsquo;t have any&hellip; It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that&rsquo;s a great plan! Who&rsquo;s plan was that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Mine!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wait! It was <b>my</b> plan.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Nooo, <b>I</b> said we needed a new plan.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And, <b>I</b> came up with Atlantic City.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> <b>Which</b>, is the new plan!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, well, why don&rsquo;t we all meet upstairs in an hour?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay! Ooh-ahh, I&rsquo;m gonna go pack. I&rsquo;m gonna go pack my ass off!</p>
<p>(They all go pack except for Ross.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Come on Rach, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, y&rsquo;know what? I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No! Rachel, you didn&rsquo;t find anyone so you can&rsquo;t tell him.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, y&rsquo;know what, that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, I-I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay. I-I can&rsquo;t watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What &lsquo;cha readin&rsquo;?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> The paper.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, what&rsquo;s it about?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Events from around the globe.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay. Uhh, Ross, y&rsquo;know what, there&rsquo;s something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody&rsquo;s saying that I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you, but I think they&rsquo;re wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, Ross, I&rsquo;m really trying to tell you something here.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Go ahead.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Umm, okay, I think I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, (pause) I&rsquo;m still in love with you Ross.</p>
<p>(Ross is stunned.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow. Umm&hellip; Huh&hellip; I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m not sure what to do with that right now.</p>
<p>(Rachel starts laughing hysterically.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What? What? Was that a joke? &rsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s mean.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (Laughing) I&rsquo;m so dead serious. I&rsquo;m totally serious.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Why are you laughing?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it&rsquo;s ridiculous! I mean, you&rsquo;re married. You&rsquo;re-you&rsquo;re married and it&rsquo;s just ridiculous, and it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y&rsquo;know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like, &ldquo;You are such an idiot!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, well I <b>am</b> married. Even though I haven&rsquo;t spoken to my wife since the wedding.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) I&rsquo;m sorry, that&rsquo;s not funny.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Actually, it kinda is. My wife won&rsquo;t return my calls. I don&rsquo;t know where my wife is. (Laughs) &ldquo;Hey Ross, where&rsquo;s the Mrs.?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t know!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh God, ohh, okay, y&rsquo;know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> The thing is y&rsquo;know, that you&rsquo;re married to Emily.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> That is what the thing is.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, things aren&rsquo;t gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No. No. No, I&rsquo;m-I&rsquo;m glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it&rsquo;s-it&rsquo;s always great when someone tells you they love you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> No thank you for&hellip; Thank you.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica and Rachel&rsquo;s, the gang is about ready to leave for Atlantic City.</h3>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Atlantic City!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Atlantic City, baby! Let&rsquo;s roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!</p>
<p>(They high-five and howl, but Phoebe suddenly stops and the guys gasp and retreat in shock.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, Pheebs, you&rsquo;re leaking?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! You&rsquo;re water broke!</p>
<p><b>The Guys:</b> Ohh!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> All right. Well, don&rsquo;t worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> The hallway between the apartments, they are taking Phoebe to the hospital but Chandler and Monica hold back.</h3>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe Phoebe&rsquo;s gonna have her babies!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I know, it&rsquo;s beautiful. Amazing.</p>
<p>(They both kiss.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know what else I can&rsquo;t believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it&rsquo;s too bad they didn&rsquo;t see us having sex.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Do you know anything about women?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. (They kiss again.)</p>
