<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, everyone is there and they are finishing watching the first episode of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. Joey is of course Mac.</h3>
<p><b>Mac:</b> (on TV) Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don&rsquo;t mix. (Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel, Chandler, and Monica aren&rsquo;t amused.)</p>
<p><b>C.H.E.E.S.E:</b> You can say that again Mac.</p>
<p><b>Mac:</b> Well, I couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you buddy. You&rsquo;re a genius.</p>
<p><b>C.H.E.E.S.E:</b> Oh yeah? Well then how come I can&rsquo;t get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?</p>
<p>(They both break into a huge laugh and do that stop-motion thing they had at the end of <i>ChiPs</i>.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?</p>
<p>(They all make happy faces as they are unable to express their feelings verbally. Finally, the phone rings and the race to answer it is won by Monica.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, it&rsquo;s your mom. (Hands him the phone.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&rsquo;s your mommy. It&rsquo;s your mommy.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Ohhhh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what they&rsquo;re gonna say.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well that was umm&hellip;Okay.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> It wasn&rsquo;t the best.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Wh-what are we gonna tell him?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, the lighting was okay.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh no you don&rsquo;t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> And I have costumes.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh great! That means I&rsquo;m stuck with, &ldquo;So, we were watching you in there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin&rsquo; right here! Whoa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Phoebe gets up.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> What are you gonna do Pheebs?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t lie to him again. Oh no I&mdash;no! I&rsquo;m just gonna press my breasts up against him.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> And say nothing?</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh, yeah that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It wasn&rsquo;t <b>that</b> good.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Rachel&rsquo;s New Office, she&rsquo;s interviewing a potential new assistant, Hilda.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?</p>
<p><b>Hilda:</b> That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?</p>
<p><b>Hilda:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I&rsquo;ve never interviewed anyone before. I&rsquo;ve actually never had anyone <b>work</b> for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn&rsquo;t the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Hilda:</b> No dear. It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in, it was nice to meet you.</p>
<p><b>Hilda:</b> Thank you! Good meeting you.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right. (Hilda exits) I&rsquo;m a total pro!</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s a knock on the door and a handsome man enters.)</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> Hello?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> (seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I&rsquo;m sorry the models are actually down the hall.</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> Actually, I&rsquo;m here about the assistant job.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what&rsquo;s&mdash;what is&mdash;what&rsquo;s your name?</p>
<p><b>Man:</b> Tag Jones.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh, go on.</p>
<p><b>Tag:</b> That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s my whole name.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&rsquo;s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let&rsquo;s-let&rsquo;s just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)</p>
<p><b>Tag:</b> I know I haven&rsquo;t worked in an office before, and I really don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience, but uh&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh come on, what are you talking about? You&rsquo;ve got three years painting houses. Two <b>whole</b> summers at <i>T.G.I. Friday&rsquo;s</i>, come on!</p>
<p><b>Tag:</b> It&rsquo;s lame, I know. But I&rsquo;m a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Central Perk, Chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in and sits in their easy chair.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I can&rsquo;t tell you. It&rsquo;s a secret.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Secret? Married people aren&rsquo;t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No I&rsquo;m serious, we should tell each other <b>every</b>thing. I do not have any secrets from you.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Really? Okay, so why don&rsquo;t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at <i>Disneyland</i>?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh no-no, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> If you tell me, I&rsquo;ll tell you what Phoebe said.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> So, Ross and I are going to <i>Disneyland</i> and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we&rsquo;re on <i>Space Mountain</i> and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God. He threw up?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebe&rsquo;s secret?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe&rsquo;s old massage place is getting fired.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&rsquo;s it?! I gave up my <i>Disneyland</i> story for that?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> That&rsquo;s right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Chandler, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Chandler, you have an assistant right?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> No, I-I just don&rsquo;t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I&rsquo;ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there&rsquo;s this guy&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> What about him?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> I love him. He&rsquo;s so pretty I wanna cry! I don&rsquo;t know what to do. Tell me what to do.</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don&rsquo;t hire an assistant because they&rsquo;re cute, you hire them because they&rsquo;re qualified.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh. No, I hear what you&rsquo;re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!</p>
<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Let&rsquo;s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh&hellip; But no! No! You can&rsquo;t-you can&rsquo;t hire him, because that&mdash;it&rsquo;s not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Don&rsquo;t show this to Monica! And don&rsquo;t tell her about the W-H-Wow!</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: The <i>Days of Our Lives</i> producer&rsquo;s office, Joey is entering to find Terry there.]</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Hey-hey-hey Joey!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey Terry!</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Good to see you again!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> It&rsquo;s been a while, huh? Wow, it&rsquo;s funny these halls look smaller than they used to.</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> It&rsquo;s a different building.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> So! Stryker Ramoray huh? When do you want me to start?</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Why don&rsquo;t we start right now!</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Here are the audition scenes. (Holds out the script.)</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Why would you think that?</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray, Stryker&rsquo;s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> Everybody has to audition.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Y&rsquo;know Terry, I-I don&rsquo;t really <b>need</b> to do this. I got my own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.</p>
<p><b>Terry:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry Joey that&rsquo;s&hellip;that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p><b>Joey:</b> Well. I guess you think you&rsquo;re pretty special huh? Sittin&rsquo; up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin&rsquo; stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y&rsquo;know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who&rsquo;s hoop&hellip; This is a star that the hoop&mdash;this hoop&mdash;<b>I</b> was Dr. Drake Ramoray!</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Rachel&rsquo;s office, she&rsquo;s there as Tag knocks on the door and enters carrying a plant.</h3>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><b>Tag:</b> I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren&rsquo;t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first&hellip; (Notices her plant) There <b>is</b> a plant in your office.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Kinda.</p>
<p><b>Tag:</b> Right. So I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t put &ldquo;good at noticing stuff&rdquo; on my resume. (Sets the plant down on her desk.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-ohh, thank you.</p>
<p><b>Tag:</b> Anyway, I&rsquo;m guessing you hired somebody.</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Tag:</b> Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. (Starts to leave.)</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> But I hired you!</p>
<p><b>Tag:</b> What?</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah! You-you got the job! You&rsquo;re my new assistant!</p>
<p><b>Tag:</b> I am?!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah!</p>
<p><b>Tag:</b> I can&rsquo;t believe it!</p>
<p><b>Rachel:</b> Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.</p>

<h3><b>Scene:</b> Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe&rsquo;s, Monica is setting the table for dinner as Chandler enters.</h3>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey! Good, you&rsquo;re home!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh it&rsquo;s always nicer to hear than, &ldquo;Aw crap! You again!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey baby. (Kisses him.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I made you a surprise.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh yeah?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I&rsquo;ve had such a craving for them.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Did you not understand the story?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, nothin&rsquo; much. Just trying to figure out what I&rsquo;m gonna do for dinner.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Huh.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (notices the table) Hey&mdash;Ooh! What&rsquo;s-what&rsquo;s that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> What you got over there? Tacos?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No! No. They&rsquo;re umm&hellip; They&rsquo;re just uh&hellip;ground beef smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhh, those are tacos.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Excuse me Mr. Mexico.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Eh, either way I&rsquo;ll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can&rsquo;t eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) What&rsquo;s so funny?!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (trying not to laugh) I&rsquo;m not laughing.</p>
<p>(Ross and Chandler move closer to her and she starts laughing again.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Chandler) You told her!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Nancy Thompson&rsquo;s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It&rsquo;s not like I chose to do it! It&rsquo;s not like&mdash;It&rsquo;s not like I said, &ldquo;Umm, what would make <b>this</b> ride more fun?!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> You&rsquo;re right. I mean I&rsquo;m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn&rsquo;t be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler laughing.)</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> I had to okay?! We&rsquo;re getting married! Married couples can&rsquo;t keep secrets from one another!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Du-ude!</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, Chandler and I are in a bar&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Did you not hear me say, &ldquo;Du-ude?!&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, Chandler&rsquo;s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you&rsquo;re right, Chandler&rsquo;s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with&hellip;girls.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh Mon, I laughed so hard&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And in <b>my</b> defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> No!</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> I don&rsquo;t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are you laughing at <i>Pampers</i>? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Y&rsquo;know when I said that because we&rsquo;re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah?</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah that was stupid. Let&rsquo;s not do that.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh, absolutely.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, definitely!</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, (gets up) if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I-I&rsquo;m gonna go hang out with some people who don&rsquo;t know the <i>Space Mountain</i> story.</p>
<p><b>Monica:</b> Then, I&rsquo;d steer clear of Phoebe.</p>
<p><b>Ross:</b> Man! (Monica mouths, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;)</p>
<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn&rsquo;t hang out with&hellip;all the guys in my office.</p>
<p>(Ross storms out.)</p>
