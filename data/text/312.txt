Scene: Monica and Rachel’s, Rachel is getting ready for her first day.
Rachel: (running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Chandler: Oh yeah, but don’t worry. I don’t think anybody’s gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Rachel: (to Ross) Tell him.
Ross: (to Chandler) It’s her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Chandler: All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Ross: Why?
Chandler: I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y’know he’s the botanist.
Ross: Oh God. Y’know, botanists are such geeks.
Chandler: Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Ross: Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)
Phoebe: (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach, I’m here with the purses!
Chandler: (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.
Rachel: (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
Phoebe: Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
Rachel: No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don’t need that today.
Ross: Honey, just relax, it’s gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don’t I come down there and I’ll take you out to lunch?
Rachel: Oh honey, thank you, but Mark’s taking me out.
Ross: Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Rachel: Yeah, it’s kinda like a ‘good luck on your first day’ sort of thing. (to Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?
Phoebe: Umm, no, it’s a purse. And there’s a thermos in it.
Rachel: Oh.
Chandler: (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Ross: What? Oh yeah, yeah I think
